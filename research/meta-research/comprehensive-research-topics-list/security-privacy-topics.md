- Investigate automated security testing tools and their integration in CI/CD pipelines for continuous security validation.

### 2. **Authentication and Authorization Best Practices**
- Research modern authentication patterns including OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, and multi-factor authentication implementation.
- Analyze role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC) patterns for complex applications.

### 3. **API Security: Rate Limiting, Input Validation, and Threat Protection**
- Research comprehensive API security strategies including DDoS protection, injection prevention, and data validation.
- Investigate API security testing methodologies and automated vulnerability scanning for REST and GraphQL APIs.

### 4. **Secure Development Lifecycle (SDLC) Integration**
- Research DevSecOps practices for integrating security throughout the software development lifecycle.
- Analyze static application security testing (SAST) and dynamic application security testing (DAST) tool implementation.

## üõ°Ô∏è Infrastructure Security

### 5. **Container and Kubernetes Security**
- Research container security best practices including image scanning, runtime protection, and network policies.
- Investigate Kubernetes security configuration including RBAC, pod security policies, and cluster hardening.

### 6. **Cloud Security Architecture and Compliance**
- Research cloud security frameworks and their implementation across AWS, Azure, and GCP environments.
- Analyze compliance requirements for GDPR, SOC 2, and other regulatory frameworks in cloud environments.

### 7. **Zero Trust Architecture Implementation**
- Research zero trust security models and their practical implementation in modern cloud-native applications.
- Investigate identity-based security, micro-segmentation, and continuous verification strategies.

## üîí Data Protection & Privacy

### 8. **Data Privacy Compliance: GDPR, CCPA, and Philippine Data Privacy Act**
