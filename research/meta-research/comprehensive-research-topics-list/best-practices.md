# Best Practices for Research Sessions

## üéØ Research Session Excellence

### 1. Preparation Best Practices

**Pre-Session Setup (15 minutes):**
- Clear workspace and minimize distractions
- Prepare research tools and bookmarking systems
- Set specific, measurable session objectives
- Review related research in the repository
- Establish time boundaries and break schedules

**Research Question Refinement:**
- Transform broad topics into specific, actionable questions
- Identify 3-5 key sub-questions to guide investigation
- Define success criteria for the research session
- Establish scope boundaries to prevent research drift

**Resource Identification:**
- Prioritize primary sources and official documentation
- Identify 5-10 high-quality starting sources
- Prepare backup sources for different perspectives
- Set up citation management and note-taking systems

### 2. Information Gathering Best Practices

**Source Quality Assessment:**
```
Tier 1 (Highest Priority):
- Official documentation and APIs
- Published research and whitepapers
- Industry reports from recognized organizations
- Government and regulatory publications

Tier 2 (High Priority):
- Technical blogs from reputable companies
- Conference presentations and academic talks
- Expert interviews and established podcasts
- Educational content from recognized institutions

Tier 3 (Supplementary):
