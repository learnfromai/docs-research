Research Request: Webhook Architecture & Best Practices - Real-time communication and integration patterns

Context: I am from the Philippines, planning to do remote work in AU, UK or US-based companies. I also plan to establish an edtech platform similar to Khan Academy but for Philippine licensure exam reviews.

Topic Category: Technical Skills > Programming & Development > API Development & Integration

Focus Areas:
- Webhook fundamentals and architecture patterns
- Real-time communication and event-driven systems
- Security considerations and authentication
- Integration patterns with service providers
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Monitoring and observability
- Testing strategies for webhook systems
- Performance and scalability
- Implementation examples with TypeScript/Express.js

Target Outcome: Comprehensive research to support building scalable, secure webhook systems for edtech applications, demonstrating expertise for remote work opportunities.
