- Limited operational expertise

**Alternative Solutions:**
```yaml
api_gateway: "Kong, Ambassador, Traefik"
ingress_controller: "NGINX, Traefik, HAProxy"
library_based: "Hystrix, Resilience4j"
cloud_native: "AWS App Mesh, Google Traffic Director"
```

|-------------|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| **Performance Degradation** | Medium | High | Gradual rollout, benchmarking |
| **Operational Complexity** | High | Medium | Training, documentation |
| **Security Misconfiguration** | Medium | High | Security reviews, automation |
| **Vendor Lock-in** | Low | Medium | Open source solutions |
| **Cost Overrun** | Medium | Medium | Resource monitoring, budgeting |
