# Service Mesh Best Practices: Production-Ready Guidelines

## 🎯 Best Practices Overview

This comprehensive guide consolidates industry best practices for service mesh implementation, operation, and maintenance. These practices are derived from real-world production deployments, with specific focus on EdTech platforms and considerations for Philippine developers building scalable applications.

```

### Service Design Principles

```yaml
# Service Mesh-Aware Service Design
service_design_principles:
  single_responsibility:
    description: "Each service has one clear purpose"
    mesh_benefit: "Simplified traffic management and security policies"
    example: "Separate user-auth and user-profile services"
  
  stateless_design:
    description: "Services don't maintain client state"
    mesh_benefit: "Load balancing and scaling work optimally"
    implementation: "Use external state stores (Redis, databases)"
  
  idempotent_operations:
    description: "Operations can be safely retried"
    mesh_benefit: "Retry policies work without side effects"
    critical_for: "Payment processing, exam submissions"
  
  graceful_degradation:
    description: "Services handle dependency failures gracefully"
    mesh_benefit: "Circuit breaking provides automatic fallbacks"
    example: "Serve cached content when content-service is down"
  
  health_check_endpoints:
    description: "Proper health and readiness endpoints"
    mesh_benefit: "Accurate load balancing and traffic routing"
    implementation: "/health (liveness), /ready (readiness)"
```

### Microservices Decomposition for EdTech

```yaml
# EdTech Service Decomposition Strategy
service_boundaries:
  user_domain:
    services:
      - "user-authentication"
      - "user-profile"
      - "user-preferences"
    rationale: "Different scaling needs and security requirements"
  
  content_domain:
    services:
      - "content-management"
      - "content-delivery"
      - "content-search"
    rationale: "Content creation vs delivery have different patterns"
  
  assessment_domain:
    services:
      - "question-bank"
      - "exam-engine"
      - "scoring-service"
    rationale: "Exam integrity requires isolated processing"
  
  analytics_domain:
    services:
      - "learning-analytics"
      - "performance-tracking"
      - "recommendation-engine"
    rationale: "Different data processing and ML requirements"

# Anti-patterns to Avoid
anti_patterns:
  distributed_monolith:
    description: "Services that must always be deployed together"
    solution: "Redesign service boundaries"
  
  chatty_interfaces:
    description: "Services making many small calls"
    solution: "Batch APIs or event-driven communication"
  
  shared_databases:
    description: "Multiple services accessing same database"
    solution: "Database per service or shared data service"
```

      kubectl get secret -n $namespace -o json | \
      jq -r '.items[] | select(.type=="kubernetes.io/tls") | 
             {name: .metadata.name, 
              cert: .data."tls.crt"} | 
             .cert' | \
      base64 -d | \
      openssl x509 -noout -dates
  }
  
  # Monitor all certificates
  for ns in linkerd istio-system edtech-production; do
