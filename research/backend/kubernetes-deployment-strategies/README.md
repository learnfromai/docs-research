## üöÄ Quick Reference

### Core Deployment Strategies Comparison

| Strategy | Use Case | Downtime | Risk Level | Complexity | Best For |
|----------|----------|----------|------------|------------|----------|
| **Rolling Update** | Standard deployments | Zero | Low | Low | Most applications |
| **Blue-Green** | Critical services | Zero | Medium | Medium | High-availability apps |
| **Canary** | Gradual rollouts | Zero | Low | High | User-facing features |
| **Recreate** | Development/testing | High | High | Low | Non-critical environments |

### Scaling Strategies Overview

| Scaling Type | Target | Trigger | Response Time | Cost Impact |
|--------------|--------|---------|---------------|-------------|
| **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)** | Pod replicas | CPU/Memory/Custom metrics | 30s-3min | Variable |
| **Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)** | Pod resources | Resource utilization | 5-10min | Predictable |
| **Cluster Autoscaler** | Node count | Pod scheduling failures | 3-10min | High impact |

### Service Discovery Methods

| Method | Latency | Reliability | Complexity | Use Case |
|--------|---------|-------------|------------|----------|
| **DNS-based** | Low | High | Low | Standard service communication |
| **Service Mesh** | Medium | Very High | High | Complex microservices |
| **API Gateway** | Medium | High | Medium | External API exposure |

## üåü Research Highlights

### Key Findings
- **Rolling updates** are optimal for 80% of EdTech applications with proper health checks
- **Service mesh** adoption increases operational complexity but provides superior observability
- **HPA with custom metrics** can reduce infrastructure costs by 30-50% for learning platforms
- **Multi-zone deployments** are critical for high-availability exam systems

### Strategic Recommendations
1. **Start Simple**: Begin with rolling updates and DNS-based service discovery
2. **Scale Gradually**: Implement HPA before VPA, add service mesh only when needed
3. **Security First**: Implement network policies and RBAC from day one
4. **Monitor Everything**: Use Prometheus + Grafana for comprehensive observability

### Industry Benchmarks
- **Target Availability**: 99.9% uptime for critical exam systems
- **Response Time**: <200ms for API responses, <2s for page loads
- **Scaling Speed**: Auto-scale in <1 minute for traffic spikes
- **Cost Optimization**: 40-60% resource utilization targets
