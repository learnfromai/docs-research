## üéØ Research Scope & Methodology

### Research Objectives
This research analyzes **15+ popular open source Express.js projects** to understand how production-ready applications are built, secured, and scaled. The goal is to provide actionable insights for developers building robust Express.js applications.

### Selection Criteria
- **Production-Ready**: Projects actively used in production environments
- **Popular**: High GitHub stars (1000+ stars) indicating community adoption
- **Well-Maintained**: Recent commits and active maintenance
- **Diverse Use Cases**: Different application types (APIs, web apps, microservices)
- **Architecture Variety**: Different architectural patterns and approaches

### Research Methodology
1. **Project Discovery**: Identify popular Express.js projects through GitHub search, curated lists, and community recommendations
2. **Code Analysis**: Deep dive into project structure, patterns, and implementation details
3. **Documentation Review**: Study project documentation, README files, and architectural decisions
4. **Pattern Extraction**: Identify common patterns, best practices, and architectural decisions
5. **Comparative Analysis**: Compare approaches across different projects and use cases
