# Research Request: NestJS Open Source Projects Analysis

## Original Prompt

[Research] Perform research for open source projects that uses nest.js

Goal is to have reference to study production-ready nest projects. Look as many as you can. I want to learn how nest is properly used, how to create secure and scalable code/architecture. How to create secure authentication if applicable. What tools or libaries they are using, etc.

## Research Scope

- Analyze production-ready NestJS open source projects
- Study proper NestJS usage patterns and best practices
- Examine secure and scalable code/architecture implementations
- Analyze authentication and security patterns
- Document tools and libraries used in production
- Provide actionable insights for building enterprise-grade NestJS applications

## Expected Deliverables

1. Comprehensive analysis of 15+ production NestJS projects
2. Authentication and security implementation patterns
3. Architecture best practices and design patterns
4. Technology stack recommendations
5. Code examples and reusable templates
6. Step-by-step implementation guide
7. Comparison analysis of different approaches
8. Performance and scalability recommendations

## Target Audience

- Developers wanting to learn production-ready NestJS patterns
- Architects designing secure and scalable NestJS applications
- Teams looking to adopt NestJS best practices
- Anyone seeking real-world examples of NestJS implementations
