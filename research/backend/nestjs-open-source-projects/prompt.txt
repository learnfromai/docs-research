Goal is to have reference to study production-ready nest projects. Look as many as you can. I want to learn how nest is properly used, how to create secure and scalable code/architecture. How to create secure authentication if applicable. What tools or libaries they are using, etc.

Research Guidelines & Requirements:
- Focus on production-ready NestJS applications
- Analyze security implementations and authentication patterns
- Study scalable architecture and design patterns
- Document popular tools and libraries used
- Include practical implementation examples
- Provide comprehensive citations and references
