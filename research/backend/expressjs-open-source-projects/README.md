## 📊 Key Findings Preview

### 🏗️ Most Common Architecture Patterns

**1. Modular MVC with Service Layer**
- Used by: Ghost, Sails.js, Parse Server
- Benefits: Clear separation of concerns, testability, scalability
- Implementation: Controllers → Services → Models → Database

**2. Plugin/Extension Architecture**
- Used by: Strapi, Express Gateway
- Benefits: Extensibility, modularity, community contributions
- Implementation: Core system + plugin registry + lifecycle hooks

**3. Schema-First GraphQL Architecture** 
- Used by: Keystone, some Strapi configurations
- Benefits: Type safety, efficient queries, auto-documentation
- Implementation: GraphQL schema → resolvers → data layer

### 🔐 Authentication Strategy Insights

**JWT + Refresh Token Pattern (Most Popular)**
```typescript
// Common implementation across projects
{
  accessToken: "15-30 minutes expiry",
  refreshToken: "7-30 days expiry", 
  storage: "httpOnly cookies or secure headers",
  rotation: "On each refresh"
}
```

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
- Universal implementation across CMS projects
- Hierarchical permissions with inheritance
- Resource-based permissions for fine-grained control

### 🛠️ Essential Tool Stack

**Most Used Dependencies:**
```json
{
  "security": ["helmet", "cors", "express-rate-limit"],
  "validation": ["joi", "yup", "express-validator"], 
  "authentication": ["passport", "jsonwebtoken"],
  "orm": ["sequelize", "prisma", "bookshelf"],
  "testing": ["jest", "supertest", "mocha"],
  "monitoring": ["winston", "morgan", "pino"]
}
```
