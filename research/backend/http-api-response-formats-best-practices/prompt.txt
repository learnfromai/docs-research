Research Request: HTTP API Success and Error Response Format Best Practices

Current Implementation Analysis:
- Zod validation errors with detailed structure including issues array and fieldErrors object
- Domain exceptions with custom error codes (AUTH_INVALID_CREDENTIALS, REG_EMAIL_EXISTS)  
- Success responses with different patterns (data arrays, objects, message-only responses)
- Consistent boolean "success" field across all response types

Research Focus:
1. Analyze current implementation patterns and structure
2. Compare against industry standards (RFC 7807, JSON:API, Google API Design Guide)
3. Identify best practices for HTTP API response formats
4. Provide migration strategy and implementation examples
5. Focus on both success and error response standardization

Goal: Comprehensive research on HTTP API response format best practices with specific focus on current implementation improvement recommendations.
