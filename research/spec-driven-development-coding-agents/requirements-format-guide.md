## Section-by-Section Guidance

### 1. Executive Summary Guidelines

**Purpose**: Provide a high-level overview that allows stakeholders to quickly understand project scope and importance.

**AI Agent Optimization**: 
- Use clear, declarative statements
- Include quantifiable business metrics
- Provide complete context for downstream AI processing

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
- Vague business value statements
- Missing success metrics
- Unclear project scope boundaries

### 2. Business Context Deep Dive

**Purpose**: Establish the business rationale that will guide all technical decisions.

**Key Components**:
- **Problem Statement**: Must be specific and measurable
- **Business Impact**: Should include quantifiable metrics where possible
- **Success Criteria**: Must be measurable and time-bound

**Example of Effective Business Context**:
```markdown
### Problem Statement
**Current State**: Customer support agents spend 40% of their time searching for information across 5 different systems, leading to average response times of 8 minutes per inquiry.

**Desired State**: Unified customer information dashboard that reduces information search time to under 30 seconds and overall response time to under 3 minutes.

**Business Impact**: 
- Reduce customer support costs by $200K annually
- Improve customer satisfaction scores from 3.2 to 4.5 (5-point scale)
- Increase agent productivity by 35%
```

### 3. User Stories Best Practices

**Structure Requirements**:
- Follow "As a [role], I want [capability], so that [benefit]" format
- Include specific, testable acceptance criteria
- Define clear Definition of Done

**AI Agent Optimization**:
- Write acceptance criteria as boolean conditions that can be tested
- Include specific examples and edge cases
- Reference personas consistently throughout stories

### 4. Functional Requirements Detailing

**Component Breakdown**:
- **Business Rules**: Specific logical conditions that govern feature behavior
- **Process Flow**: Step-by-step description of feature operation
- **Edge Cases**: Unusual scenarios and their expected handling
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error scenarios and responses

**Example of Well-Structured Functional Requirement**:
```markdown
#### Feature: User Password Reset
**Description**: Allow users to securely reset their password via email verification

**Business Rules**:
1. Password reset tokens expire after 15 minutes of generation
2. Users can only request one password reset token per 5-minute period
3. New passwords must meet complexity requirements (8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, number, special char)

**Process Flow**:
1. User enters email address on password reset form
2. System validates email exists in user database
3. System generates secure reset token and sends email
4. User clicks email link and enters new password
5. System validates token and password requirements
6. System updates password and invalidates reset token

**Edge Cases**:
- **Invalid Email**: Display generic "reset link sent" message for security
- **Expired Token**: Redirect to password reset form with "token expired" message
- **Already Used Token**: Display "token already used" message

**Error Handling**:
- **Email Service Down**: Queue email for retry, display "processing" message to user
- **Token Validation Failure**: Log security event, display generic error message
- **Password Validation Failure**: Display specific password requirement violations
```

### 5. Non-Functional Requirements Framework

**Categories to Address**:
- Performance (response times, throughput)
- Security (authentication, authorization, data protection)
- Reliability (uptime, disaster recovery)
- Usability (user experience, accessibility)
- Maintainability (code quality, documentation)

**Quantifiable Requirements**:
Always specify measurable criteria:
- "Response time under 2 seconds for 95% of requests"
- "Support 1000 concurrent users"
- "99.9% uptime during business hours"

## AI Agent Integration Patterns

### Claude Code Planning Optimization

**Effective Prompt Structure**:
```markdown
Based on these requirements, create comprehensive design.md and implementation-plan.md files that:

1. Address every functional requirement with specific technical solutions
2. Meet all non-functional requirements through architectural decisions
3. Include API specifications for all integration points
4. Provide implementation guidance for all user stories
5. Include testing strategies that validate acceptance criteria

Ensure full traceability between requirements and design elements.
```

### GitHub Copilot Implementation Guidance

**Code Comment Structure**:
```javascript
/**
 * Password Reset Feature Implementation
 * 
 * Requirements Reference: requirements.md Section 4.3
 * User Story: "As a user, I want to reset my password via email..."
 * 
 * Business Rules Implemented:
 * - 15-minute token expiry (Rule 4.3.1)
 * - 5-minute request rate limiting (Rule 4.3.2) 
 * - Password complexity validation (Rule 4.3.3)
 * 
 * Acceptance Criteria:
 * - Token generation and email delivery

 */
```
