Various topics like, career progression in tech, or tools for frontend development, backend developmetn, devops, cloud, etc.

Anything that will be helpful in IT/ComSci field, career, technical skills, etc. For business part, as an IT, like research for all things needed to start an edtech business similar to Khan Academy with a platform but the topics are board exam review for Philippine board exams. Research for best practices for all, etc. I want you to give a comprehensive list, as much as possible, where research topic would be one session for the copilot agent to research.
