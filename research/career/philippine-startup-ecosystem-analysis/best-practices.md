### ⚠️ Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them

#### The "Philippine Startup Death Traps"

**1. The "Build First, Validate Later" Trap**
```markdown
❌ Common Mistake: 
Spending 12+ months building "perfect" product before user feedback

✅ Best Practice:
- Week 1-2: Landing page + email signup
- Week 3-4: User interviews (50+ people)  
- Week 5-8: Paper prototype testing
- Week 9-16: Basic MVP with core feature only
- Week 17+: Iterative improvement based on user data
```

**2. The "Friends & Family Feedback" Trap**
```markdown
❌ Common Mistake:
Relying on positive feedback from personal network

✅ Analytics-Driven Validation:
- User retention: >40% week-1, >20% month-1
- Net Promoter Score: >50 (promoters minus detractors)
- Product-market fit survey: >40% "very disappointed" if product disappeared
- Revenue validation: Paying customers, not just free users
```

**3. The "Philippine Market Only" Trap**
```markdown
❌ Limited Thinking:
Building only for Philippine market, neglecting regional opportunity

✅ Regional Strategy:
- English-first content creation
- Currency-agnostic pricing strategy  
- Culturally adaptable UX design
- International payment method support
- ASEAN expansion roadmap from day one
```

**4. The "Perfect Product" Trap**
```markdown
❌ Over-Engineering:
Trying to build every feature before launch

✅ Minimum Viable Product Focus:
Core Features Only:
- User registration/authentication
- Practice question database (1,000+ questions)
- Basic progress tracking
- Payment processing
- Mobile-responsive design

Phase 2 Features (post-validation):
- Advanced analytics
- Live classes
- Community features
- Offline mode
- Gamification
```
