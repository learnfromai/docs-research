### üéØ Decision Framework and Recommendations

#### **Decision Matrix by Personal Situation**

**Use this scoring system: Rate each factor 1-10 based on your priorities, then multiply by the scores below:**

| **Factor** | **Weight** | **PH Startups** | **AU Remote** | **UK Remote** | **US Remote** |
|------------|------------|-----------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Compensation** | Your Priority (1-10) | 3 | 8 | 7 | 9 |
| **Career Growth** | Your Priority (1-10) | 5 | 8 | 8 | 9 |
| **Work-Life Balance** | Your Priority (1-10) | 6 | 9 | 8 | 5 |
| **Family Proximity** | Your Priority (1-10) | 10 | 7 | 7 | 7 |
| **Cultural Comfort** | Your Priority (1-10) | 10 | 6 | 6 | 5 |
| **Risk Level** | Your Priority (1-10) | 8 | 6 | 6 | 5 |
| **Skill Development** | Your Priority (1-10) | 5 | 8 | 8 | 9 |

**Example Calculation for Someone Prioritizing Career Growth and Compensation:**
- Career Growth Priority: 9, Compensation Priority: 9, Family Proximity Priority: 6
- US Remote Score: (9√ó9) + (9√ó9) + (6√ó7) = 81 + 81 + 42 = 204
- Philippine Startups Score: (9√ó5) + (9√ó3) + (6√ó10) = 45 + 27 + 60 = 132

#### **Specific Recommendations by Profile**
