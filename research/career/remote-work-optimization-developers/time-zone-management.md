    - Project milestone discussions
    - Technical guidance requests
    - Client feedback incorporation
    - Schedule coordination
    
  Level_3_Normal: "< 24 hours response expected"
    - General project updates
    - Code review requests
    - Documentation questions
    - Non-critical feature discussions
    
  Level_4_Low: "< 72 hours response expected"
    - Process improvement suggestions
    - Knowledge sharing
    - Tool recommendations

Message_Structure_Template:
  subject_line: "[PRIORITY-LEVEL] [PROJECT] - [BRIEF DESCRIPTION]"
  body_structure:
    - Context/Background (2-3 sentences)
    - Specific Question/Request
    - Proposed Solution/Next Steps
    - Required Response/Decision
    - Deadline/Timeline
  
  example: |
    Subject: [URGENT] E-commerce Site - Payment Gateway Integration Blocker
    
    Context: Working on payment integration for the checkout process. 
    Stripe API is returning authentication errors despite correct credentials.
    
    Specific Issue: Need confirmation on whether we're using live or test API keys
    
    Proposed Solution: Switch to test environment temporarily to unblock development
    
    Required from you: Confirmation of API environment and any specific Stripe account settings
    
    Timeline: Need response by 2:00 PM your time to stay on schedule for tomorrow's demo
