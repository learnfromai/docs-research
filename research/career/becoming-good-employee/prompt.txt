### Research Request

[Research] Research how to become a good employee. I'm a full stack software engineer. What tools I need, what websites I should know about, etc. 

I'm planning to learn cloud computing too with AWS, and probably take certifications like SAA, DOP, or related to security, AI, etc. Probably learn MLOps too, etc. I want to work in start ups, though I currently work in an established company mainly maintaining more than decade-old legacy code.
