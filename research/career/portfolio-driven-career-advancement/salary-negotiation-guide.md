  philippines: {
    averageMonthlyExpenses: '$800 - $1,500';
    comfortableLifestyle: '$1,200 - $2,000';
    luxuryLifestyle: '$2,000 - $3,500';
  };
  comparison: {
    australia: {
      similarLifestyle: '$3,500 - $5,000';
      arbitrageAdvantage: '2.5x - 3x purchasing power';
    };
    uk: {
      similarLifestyle: '$3,000 - $4,500';
      arbitrageAdvantage: '2x - 3x purchasing power';
    };
    us: {
      similarLifestyle: '$4,000 - $6,000';

    vesting: 'Typically 4 years with 1-year cliff';
    exercise: 'Must purchase stock to realize value';
    taxation: 'Taxed on exercise and sale (complex for Philippine residents)';
  };
  restrictedStock: {
    definition: 'Actual company shares granted with restrictions';
    vesting: 'Similar timeline to options';
    taxation: 'Taxed on vesting and sale';
    liquidity: 'Easier to understand value';
  };
  rsu: {
    definition: 'Restricted Stock Units - promise of future shares';
    vesting: 'Converts to actual shares on vesting schedule';
    taxation: 'Taxed as ordinary income on vesting';
    companies: 'Common at public companies';
  };
}
```

**Equity Valuation Framework:**
```markdown
# Equity Value Assessment

## Company Stage Analysis
- **Pre-Series A**: High risk, potentially high reward (0.5-2% typical)

- **Series C+**: Lower risk, steady growth (0.05-0.5% typical)
- **Public Company**: Lowest risk, predictable value (RSUs typical)

## Valuation Methodology
1. **Current Valuation**: Latest funding round valuation
2. **Growth Projections**: 3-5 year growth estimates
3. **Exit Scenarios**: IPO or acquisition potential and timeline
4. **Dilution Factor**: Future funding rounds will reduce percentage
5. **Liquidity Timeline**: When can equity be converted to cash

## Risk Assessment
- **Company Risk**: Probability of success/failure
- **Market Risk**: Industry and economic conditions
- **Liquidity Risk**: Time to cash conversion
- **Tax Implications**: Philippine tax treatment of international equity
```

## üí° Advanced Negotiation Tactics

### Leverage Building Strategies

**Multiple Offer Strategy:**
```markdown
# Building Negotiation Leverage

## Timeline Management
- Apply to multiple companies simultaneously
- Coordinate interview processes for similar timing
- Use competing offers to negotiate better terms
- Maintain professional relationships regardless of outcome

## Information Asymmetry
- Research company financial health and growth
- Understand their hiring urgency and timeline
- Know competing salary ranges and benefits
- Leverage industry connections for insider insights

## Value Demonstration
- Quantify potential impact you can make
- Reference specific company challenges you can solve
- Provide portfolio examples relevant to their needs
- Demonstrate understanding of their business model
```

**Negotiation Psychology:**
- **Anchoring**: First number mentioned influences entire negotiation
- **Reciprocity**: Concessions should be mutual and balanced
- **Scarcity**: Limited-time aspects create urgency
- **Social Proof**: Reference market rates and peer compensation

### Handling Difficult Negotiations

**Common Objections and Responses:**
```markdown
# Objection Handling Framework

## "Our budget is fixed"
Response: "I understand budget constraints. Could we explore creative solutions like a performance bonus structure or additional equity to bridge the gap?"

## "You're asking for too much"
Response: "I appreciate your perspective. Let me share the market research that informed my request. Perhaps we can find a middle ground that works for both of us."

## "We can't match other offers"
Response: "I'm not necessarily looking for you to match exactly. What matters most is the total package and growth opportunity. What flexibility do you have in other areas?"

## "Take it or leave it"
Response: "I really want to make this work. Can you help me understand what constraints you're working within? Maybe there's another way to structure this."
```

**When to Walk Away:**
- Offer is more than 20% below market rate with no negotiation flexibility
- Company culture or values fundamentally misaligned
- Role doesn't provide growth opportunities you need
- Total compensation doesn't meet your minimum requirements
- Negotiation process reveals concerning company practices
