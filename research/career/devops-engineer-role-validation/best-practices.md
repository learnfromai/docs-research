# Multi-stage Docker build optimization
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production && npm cache clean --force

FROM node:18-alpine AS runtime
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs && \
    adduser -S nextjs -u 1001
    
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --chown=nextjs:nodejs . .

USER nextjs
EXPOSE 3000
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost:3000/health || exit 1

CMD ["npm", "start"]

```yaml
Monitoring Pillars:

1. Infrastructure Monitoring:
   Metrics:
     - CPU, Memory, Disk, Network utilization
     - Container resource consumption
     - Kubernetes cluster health
     - Cloud service quotas and limits
   
   Tools: Prometheus, CloudWatch, DataDog
   Alerting: PagerDuty, Slack, Email

2. Application Performance Monitoring:
   Metrics:
     - Response times and throughput
     - Error rates and success rates
     - Database query performance
     - Cache hit ratios
   
   Tools: New Relic, Datadog APM, Jaeger
   Dashboards: Grafana, Native APM dashboards

3. Log Management:
   Collection:
     - Application logs with structured format
     - Infrastructure logs (system, container)
     - Security logs and audit trails
     - Performance and access logs
   
   Tools: ELK Stack, Splunk, CloudWatch Logs
   Analysis: Log aggregation, pattern detection

4. Synthetic Monitoring:
   Coverage:
     - API endpoint availability
     - User journey monitoring
     - Performance regression detection
     - Geographic performance validation
   
   Tools: Pingdom, DataDog Synthetics, AWS Route 53
```

#### Alert Management Best Practices
```yaml
Alert Hierarchy:
  Critical (P1): Service completely down, data loss risk
    Response Time: Immediate (5 minutes)
    Escalation: On-call engineer, manager after 15 minutes
    Examples: Database unavailable, payment system down
  
  High (P2): Significant service degradation
    Response Time: 30 minutes during business hours
    Escalation: Team lead after 2 hours
    Examples: High error rates, performance degradation
  
  Medium (P3): Minor issues, potential future problems
    Response Time: Next business day
    Escalation: Weekly team review
    Examples: Disk space warnings, non-critical failures
  
  Low (P4): Informational, monitoring anomalies
    Response Time: Weekly review
    Examples: Capacity planning triggers, trend notifications

Alert Quality Metrics:
  - Alert fatigue prevention (max 5 alerts per engineer per day)
  - False positive rate < 5%
  - Mean time to acknowledge < 10 minutes
  - Mean time to resolution tracking
  - Regular alert review and tuning
```
