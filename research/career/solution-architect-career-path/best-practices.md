- Use living documentation approaches (code comments, automated docs)
- Regularly review and update architecture documentation

### Stakeholder Communication
- Tailor communication to audience technical level
- Use visual aids and diagrams to explain complex concepts
- Follow up technical discussions with written summaries
- Establish regular communication rhythms with key stakeholders
```

### Career Development Pitfalls

#### 1. **Certification Without Experience**
```markdown
## Balancing Certifications and Experience

### Avoiding Paper Tiger Syndrome
