3. **Problem Solving**: "How would you add [new requirement] to this system?"
4. **Optimization**: "Where would you optimize this for better performance?"
5. **Scaling**: "How would this handle 10x more users?"

### Architecture Discussion Topics

**Typical Interview Questions:**
```typescript
// Example discussion points for expense tracker
interface InterviewTopics {
  dataModeling: {
    question: "How did you design the expense data model?";
    lookingFor: "Understanding of normalization, relationships, indexing";
  };
  
  authentication: {
    question: "Explain your authentication implementation";
    lookingFor: "Security awareness, token management, session handling";
  };
  
  stateManagement: {
    question: "How do you manage application state?";
    lookingFor: "Understanding of state patterns, data flow, performance";
  };
  
  errorHandling: {
    question: "How do you handle errors and edge cases?";
    lookingFor: "Comprehensive error strategy, user experience, debugging";
  };
  
  testing: {
