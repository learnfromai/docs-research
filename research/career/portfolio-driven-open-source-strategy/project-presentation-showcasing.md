### Visual Documentation Strategy

**Screenshot Categories**:
```typescript
interface VisualDocumentation {
  hero_shot: {
    purpose: "First impression of application quality";
    content: "Dashboard or main interface in pristine state";
    specifications: "1920x1080, high-quality, professional styling";
  };
  
  feature_demonstrations: {
    purpose: "Show key functionality and user experience";
    content: "Step-by-step feature usage with clear annotations";
    specifications: "Multiple resolutions, mobile and desktop views";
  };
  
  architecture_diagrams: {
    purpose: "Explain technical design and system structure";
    content: "Clean, professional diagrams with clear relationships";
    tools: "Draw.io, Lucidchart, or Mermaid for GitHub integration";
  };
  
  performance_charts: {
    purpose: "Demonstrate optimization and monitoring";
    content: "Loading times, API response metrics, resource usage";
    format: "Charts, graphs, and comparative analysis";
  };
}
```

### Code Documentation Standards

**JSDoc/TSDoc Implementation**:
```typescript
/**
 * ExpenseService handles all expense-related business operations
 * 
 * This service implements the Clean Architecture pattern with dependency injection
 * for testability and maintainability. It serves as the primary interface between
 * the application layer and domain business logic.
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const expenseService = new ExpenseService(repository, validator, eventBus);
 * const result = await expenseService.createExpense({
 *   amount: 25.50,
 *   description: "Coffee meeting",
 *   categoryId: "business-expenses"
 * });
 * 
 * if (result.isSuccess()) {
 *   console.log('Expense created:', result.value.id);
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * @see {@link IExpenseService} for interface contract
 * @see {@link ExpenseRepository} for data persistence layer
 * @since 1.0.0
 */
export class ExpenseService implements IExpenseService {
  /**
   * Creates a new expense with comprehensive validation and event publishing
   * 
   * @param dto - Expense creation data transfer object
   * @returns Promise resolving to Success<Expense> or Failure<ValidationError>
   * 
   * @throws {ValidationError} When input data fails business rule validation
   * @throws {RepositoryError} When database operation fails
   * 
   * @example
   * ```typescript
   * const result = await service.createExpense({
   *   amount: 150.00,
   *   description: "Team lunch",
   *   categoryId: "business-meals",
   *   date: new Date('2024-01-15')
   * });
   * ```
   */
  async createExpense(dto: CreateExpenseDTO): Promise<Result<Expense, Error>> {
    // Implementation with clear error handling and business logic
  }
}
```

## Demo Presentation Strategies

### Live Demo Best Practices

**Demo Environment Setup**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Demo preparation script
echo "üöÄ Preparing demo environment..."

# Ensure clean database state
npm run db:reset
npm run db:seed:demo

# Start all services
docker-compose up -d
npm run dev

# Verify all services are healthy
npm run health-check

# Open demo browser with prepared state
open "http://localhost:3000/demo"

echo "‚úÖ Demo environment ready!"
```

**Demo Script Structure**:
```markdown
