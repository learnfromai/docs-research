# Metrics That Matter to Employers - Portfolio-Driven Open Source Strategy

## Introduction

Understanding which metrics employers actually care about when evaluating portfolio projects helps focus development effort on high-impact areas. This guide identifies the key performance indicators, code quality metrics, and professional practices that hiring managers and technical leads use to assess candidate capabilities.

## GitHub Profile Metrics

### Repository Health Indicators

**Primary Repository Metrics**:
```typescript
interface RepositoryHealthMetrics {
  activity_indicators: {
    commit_frequency: "Daily commits over 3+ months";
    recent_activity: "Commits within last 30 days";
    contribution_consistency: "No gaps > 7 days in 3 months";
    commit_quality: "Meaningful changes, not just line additions";
  };
  
  community_engagement: {
    stars: "10+ stars shows community interest";
    forks: "2+ forks indicates utility to others";
    watchers: "5+ watchers shows ongoing interest";
    issues: "Active issue discussion and resolution";
    pull_requests: "Community contributions or self-improvement";
  };
  
  documentation_quality: {
    readme_completeness: "Comprehensive setup and usage docs";
    api_documentation: "Clear interface and endpoint docs";
    contributing_guidelines: "Professional community standards";
    changelog: "Version history and release notes";
  };
}
```

### Contribution Graph Analysis

**Employer Evaluation Criteria**:
- **Consistency Over Intensity**: Prefer 100 commits over 3 months vs 100 commits in 1 week
- **Pattern Recognition**: Look for sustained effort rather than sporadic bursts
- **Professional Rhythm**: Work patterns that suggest good time management
- **Quality Correlation**: Higher commit frequency with maintained code quality

**Benchmark Standards**:
```typescript
interface ContributionBenchmarks {
  junior_level: {
    daily_commits: "50% of days over 3 months";
    streak_length: "30+ day maximum streak";
    total_contributions: "200+ commits in 6 months";
  };
  
  mid_level: {
    daily_commits: "70% of days over 3 months";
    streak_length: "60+ day maximum streak";
    total_contributions: "400+ commits in 6 months";
  };
  
  senior_level: {
    daily_commits: "80% of days over 3 months";
    streak_length: "100+ day maximum streak";
