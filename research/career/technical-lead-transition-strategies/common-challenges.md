## Technical vs. Leadership Balance Challenges

### 1. The "Coding Addiction" Challenge

**Problem Description:**
Many new technical leaders struggle to reduce their hands-on coding time, leading to bottlenecks, micromanagement, and failure to develop team capabilities.

**Common Symptoms:**
- Taking on critical coding tasks that should be delegated
- Reviewing every line of code personally
- Being the go-to person for all technical decisions
- Working excessive hours to complete both coding and leadership tasks
- Team members becoming dependent rather than independent

**Root Causes:**
