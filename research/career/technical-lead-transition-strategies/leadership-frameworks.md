# Leadership Frameworks - Technical Lead Transition Strategies

## Overview

This document explores **proven leadership frameworks and methodologies specifically applicable to technical leadership roles**, with emphasis on frameworks that work effectively in remote work environments and international contexts. These frameworks provide structured approaches to developing leadership capabilities and managing technical teams.

## Core Leadership Frameworks

### 1. Situational Leadership® Model (Hersey-Blanchard)

**Framework Overview:**
The Situational Leadership model suggests that effective leadership requires adapting leadership style based on the readiness and competence of team members for specific tasks.

**Four Leadership Styles:**

| Style | Description | When to Use | Team Member Characteristics |
|-------|-------------|-------------|----------------------------|
| **S1: Directing** | High directive, low supportive behavior | New tasks, low competence | Low competence, high commitment |
| **S2: Coaching** | High directive, high supportive behavior | Learning phase | Some competence, low commitment |
| **S3: Supporting** | Low directive, high supportive behavior | Competent but lacks confidence | High competence, variable commitment |
| **S4: Delegating** | Low directive, low supportive behavior | Autonomous work | High competence, high commitment |

**Technical Leadership Application:**

### Code Review Scenarios
- **S1: Directing** - Junior developer, new codebase: Provide specific guidance and detailed feedback
- **S2: Coaching** - Mid-level developer learning new technology: Explain reasoning, provide resources
- **S3: Supporting** - Senior developer, familiar technology: Ask questions, provide encouragement
- **S4: Delegating** - Expert team member: Set expectations, trust execution

### Project Assignment Approach
- **S1: Directing** - Critical path, high-risk tasks: Clear specifications, frequent check-ins
- **S2: Coaching** - Learning opportunities: Mentoring approach, guided discovery
