interface SkillAssessment {
  frontend: {
    react: number;        // Target: 4+
    nextjs: number;       // Target: 3+
    typescript: number;   // Target: 4+
    tailwindcss: number;  // Target: 3+
  };
  backend: {
    nodejs: number;       // Target: 4+
    express: number;      // Target: 4+
    databases: number;    // PostgreSQL/MongoDB - Target: 3+
    apis: number;         // REST/GraphQL - Target: 4+
  };
  devops: {
    aws: number;          // Target: 3+
    docker: number;       // Target: 3+
    cicd: number;         // Target: 3+
    monitoring: number;   // Target: 2+
  };
  tools: {
    git: number;          // Target: 4+

}
```

**Rate Increase Communication:**
```markdown
Subject: Service Rate Update - Effective [Date]

Hi [Client Name],

I wanted to give you advance notice that my hourly rate will be increasing to $[new rate] for new projects starting [date].

This adjustment reflects:
- The specialized expertise I've developed in [specific area]
- Increased demand for my services

```

#### 6.2 Long-Term Client Relationship Development

**Retainer Contract Templates:**
```typescript
interface RetainerAgreement {
  monthlyCommitment: {
    hours: number;           // 40-80 hours/month
    rate: number;           // Discounted from hourly rate
    scope: string[];        // Defined service areas
  };
  
  terms: {
    duration: string;       // 3-6 month initial terms
    renewal: string;        // Automatic or manual renewal
    termination: string;    // 30-day notice period
  };
  
  serviceLevel: {
    responseTime: string;   // Within 4 business hours

    impact: "20-30% productivity increase";
  };
  
  option2_JuniorDeveloper: {
    role: "Code implementation, testing, documentation";
    cost: "$15-25/hour";
    impact: "2x project capacity";
  };
  
  option3_Designer: {
    role: "UI/UX design, branding, marketing materials";
    cost: "$20-35/hour";
    impact: "Premium service offerings";
  };
}
```

#### 7.2 Passive Income Development
