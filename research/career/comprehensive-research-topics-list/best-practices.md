- **Time-bound**: Defined research timeframe

**Example Good Research Questions:**
```
‚ùå Bad: "What's the best programming language?"
‚úÖ Good: "What are the pros and cons of TypeScript vs. vanilla JavaScript for a team of 5 developers building a SaaS product in 2024?"

‚ùå Bad: "How do I get a better job?"
‚úÖ Good: "What specific skills and experience do full-stack engineers need to transition to technical leadership roles at mid-size tech companies?"

‚ùå Bad: "Should I use microservices?"
‚úÖ Good: "What are the decision criteria for choosing microservices vs. monolith architecture for a team of 8 developers building a B2B platform with 1000+ users?"
```
