}, (accessToken, refreshToken, profile, done) => {
  // Secure user handling logic
}));
```

  let encrypted = cipher.update(text, 'utf8', 'hex');
  encrypted += cipher.final('hex');
  return {
    iv: iv.toString('hex'),

## üõ†Ô∏è Developer-Specific Study Strategies

### 1. Code-First Learning Approach
Instead of memorizing theory, implement security concepts in code:

```javascript
// Memory aid: Implement while learning
const securityConcepts = {
  authentication: () => implementJWT(),
  authorization: () => implementRBAC(),
  encryption: () => implementAES(),
  hashing: () => implementBcrypt(),
  inputValidation: () => implementJoi()
};
```

### 2. Version Control for Study Materials
```bash
# Create study repository
git init security-plus-study
git add study-notes/
git commit -m "Add Domain 1 study notes"

# Track progress
git branch week-1-foundation
git branch week-2-assessment
git branch week-3-attacks-threats
```

### 3. Test-Driven Learning
```javascript
// Write tests for security concepts
describe('Password Security', () => {
  it('should hash passwords with salt', () => {
    const password = 'testPassword123!';
    const hash = hashPassword(password);
    expect(hash).not.toBe(password);
    expect(hash.length).toBeGreaterThan(50);
  });
});
```

```javascript
const weeklyProgress = {
  week: 1,
  hoursStudied: 12,
  practiceTestScore: 65,
  domainsCompleted: ['1.1', '1.2'],
  handsOnLabs: 3,
  confidenceLevel: 6,  // 1-10 scale
  nextWeekGoals: ['Complete Domain 1', 'Score 70% on practice test']
};
```

### Milestone Celebrations
- **Week 4**: Complete first domain - Treat yourself to new development book
- **Week 8**: Midpoint achievement - Upgrade development setup or tools
- **Week 12**: Practice test 85%+ - Plan post-certification celebration
- **Week 15**: Exam passed - Share achievement and plan next career step

## üö® Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Pitfall 1: Over-Engineering Study Approach
**Problem**: Trying to implement every security concept in production code
**Solution**: Focus on understanding concepts first, implementation second

### Pitfall 2: Neglecting Memorization
**Problem**: Relying only on conceptual understanding
**Solution**: Use spaced repetition for ports, protocols, and acronyms

### Pitfall 3: Insufficient Practice Tests
**Problem**: Not taking enough timed practice exams
**Solution**: Minimum 10 full-length practice tests before exam

### Pitfall 4: Weak Areas Avoidance
**Problem**: Spending too much time on comfortable topics
**Solution**: Allocate 40% of time to weakest domains
