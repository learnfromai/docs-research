   - Opportunity cost value: ₱50,000 - ₱150,000 (salary during saved time)

2. **Success Rate Improvement**
   - Industry average pass rate: 65-70%
   - Platform user pass rate: 85-90%
   - Success rate improvement: 20-25 percentage points
   - Value of passing first attempt: ₱100,000+ (avoid retake costs and delays)

3. **Career Advancement Acceleration**

- Value-to-price ratio: 10:1 to 25:1
- Customer ROI: 1,000% - 2,500%

Pricing Ceiling Calculation:
- Maximum rational price: 10% of first-year salary increase
- Licensed nurse salary increase: ₱180,000/year
- Pricing ceiling: ₱18,000 for full program
- Current pricing: ₱8,000 - ₱20,000 (well within value range)
