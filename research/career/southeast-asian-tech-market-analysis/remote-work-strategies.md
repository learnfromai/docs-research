#### Tracking Tools and Systems
```python
# Python script for tracking remote work metrics
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

class RemoteWorkTracker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.applications = []
        self.interviews = []
        self.offers = []
        self.performance_metrics = []
    
    def log_application(self, company, position, date, status="submitted"):
        application = {
            'date': date,
            'company': company,
            'position': position,
            'status': status,
            'follow_up_date': date + timedelta(days=7)
        }
        self.applications.append(application)
    
    def calculate_conversion_rates(self):
        total_applications = len(self.applications)
        interviews = len([a for a in self.applications if a['status'] in ['interview', 'offer']])
        offers = len([a for a in self.applications if a['status'] == 'offer'])
        
        return {
            'interview_rate': (interviews / total_applications) * 100 if total_applications > 0 else 0,
            'offer_rate': (offers / total_applications) * 100 if total_applications > 0 else 0,
            'offer_to_interview_rate': (offers / interviews) * 100 if interviews > 0 else 0
        }
    
    def monthly_report(self):
        # Generate monthly performance report
        current_month = datetime.now().month
        monthly_apps = [a for a in self.applications if a['date'].month == current_month]
        
        report = {
            'applications_submitted': len(monthly_apps),
            'interviews_scheduled': len([a for a in monthly_apps if 'interview' in a['status']]),
            'offers_received': len([a for a in monthly_apps if a['status'] == 'offer']),
            'conversion_rates': self.calculate_conversion_rates()

# Usage example
tracker = RemoteWorkTracker()
tracker.log_application("Atlassian", "Senior Full Stack Developer", datetime.now())
tracker.log_application("Canva", "Frontend Engineer", datetime.now())
monthly_stats = tracker.monthly_report()
```
