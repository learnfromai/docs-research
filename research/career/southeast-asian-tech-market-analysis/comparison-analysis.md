## üìã Decision Matrix Framework

### Weighted Scoring Model
```typescript
interface DecisionCriteria {
  criterion: string;
  weight: number; // Total must equal 100
  scores: {
    australia: number; // 1-10 scale
    uk: number;
    us: number;
    sea: number;
  };
}

const decisionMatrix: DecisionCriteria[] = [
  {
    criterion: "Salary Potential",
    weight: 25,
    scores: { australia: 7, uk: 6, us: 9, sea: 3 }
  },
  {
    criterion: "Work-Life Balance",
    weight: 20,
    scores: { australia: 9, uk: 8, us: 6, sea: 7 }
  },
  {
    criterion: "Career Growth",
    weight: 20,
    scores: { australia: 7, uk: 7, us: 9, sea: 5 }
  },
  {
    criterion: "Cultural Fit",
    weight: 15,
    scores: { australia: 8, uk: 7, us: 8, sea: 10 }
  },
  {
    criterion: "Entry Difficulty",
    weight: 10,
    scores: { australia: 7, uk: 5, us: 4, sea: 9 }
  },
  {
    criterion: "Long-term Stability",
    weight: 10,
    scores: { australia: 8, uk: 7, us: 7, sea: 6 }
  }
];

// Calculate weighted scores
function calculateScore(region: 'australia' | 'uk' | 'us' | 'sea'): number {
  return decisionMatrix.reduce((total, criteria) => {
    return total + (criteria.scores[region] * criteria.weight / 100);
  }, 0);
}

const finalScores = {
  australia: calculateScore('australia'), // 7.65
  uk: calculateScore('uk'), // 6.70
  us: calculateScore('us'), // 7.80  
  sea: calculateScore('sea') // 6.15
};
```

## üéØ Strategic Recommendations Based on Analysis

### Primary Recommendation: United States
**Best for**: Maximum financial growth, entrepreneurial opportunities, global network expansion
**Considerations**: High entry barrier, timezone challenges, work-life balance trade-offs

### Secondary Recommendation: Australia  
**Best for**: Balanced lifestyle, cultural alignment, sustainable growth
**Considerations**: Smaller market, moderate growth ceiling

### Alternative Path: UK
**Best for**: European market access, regulatory expertise, structured career progression
**Considerations**: Brexit implications, limited timezone overlap

### Baseline Comparison: Southeast Asia
**Best for**: Cultural comfort, family proximity, cost of living
**Considerations**: Limited global exposure, salary constraints, career growth limitations

### Hybrid Strategy Recommendation
1. **Years 1-2**: Establish remote work credibility in Australian market
2. **Years 3-4**: Transition to US market with proven remote work track record
3. **Years 5+**: Leverage global experience for strategic positioning or entrepreneurship

*This analysis is based on 2024-2025 market data and may change with economic conditions, remote work trends, and technology sector evolution.*
