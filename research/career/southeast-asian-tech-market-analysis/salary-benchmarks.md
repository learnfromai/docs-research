## 💼 Negotiation Strategies by Market

### Australia Negotiation Framework
```markdown
## Australian Salary Negotiation Guide

### Pre-Negotiation Preparation
- Research salary bands on platforms like Glassdoor, PayScale, Seek
- Understand superannuation implications (10.5% on top of salary)
- Know the fair work standards and employee rights
- Prepare examples of Asia-Pacific market expertise

### Negotiation Points
1. **Base Salary**: Focus on market median for your experience
2. **Superannuation**: Some companies offer additional super contributions
3. **Professional Development**: $3,000-5,000 annually is reasonable
4. **Remote Work Allowance**: $1,000-2,000 for home office setup
5. **Flexible Working**: Core hours with flexibility on start/end times

### Cultural Considerations
- Australians appreciate direct but friendly communication
- Avoid being overly aggressive; collaborative approach works better
- Show appreciation for work-life balance culture
- Mention timezone advantages for Asia-Pacific business

### Sample Negotiation Script
"Thank you for the offer. I'm excited about joining [Company]. Based on my research of the Australian market and my specific experience with Asia-Pacific projects, I believe a salary of $[X] would be appropriate. This aligns with market rates for someone with my React/AWS expertise and Asia-Pacific business understanding. I'm also hoping we can discuss a professional development budget of $3,000 annually."
```

### UK Negotiation Approach
```markdown
## UK Salary Negotiation Strategy

### Market Research Tools
- Glassdoor UK, PayScale UK, CWJobs salary checker
- London vs. outside London salary differentials
- Brexit impact on talent market (increased demand)

### Negotiation Leverage Points

```

### US Negotiation Tactics
```markdown
## US Market Negotiation Framework

### Research Platforms
- levels.fyi for tech companies
- Glassdoor, PayScale, Salary.com
- AngelList for startup equity data
- Blind for insider salary information

### High-Impact Negotiation Points
1. **Base Salary**: Use levels.fyi data for role/company
2. **Signing Bonus**: Common for mid to senior levels
3. **Equity**: Understand vesting schedules and company valuation
4. **Performance Bonus**: Target percentage of salary
5. **Remote Work Premium**: Location-independent salary

### Equity Negotiation
- Understand company stage and valuation
- Ask about refresh grants and promotion equity increases
- Consider equity value vs. cash trade-offs
- Negotiate vesting acceleration in certain scenarios

### Cultural Approach
- Be confident and results-oriented
- Quantify your impact with specific metrics
- Show enthusiasm for company mission
- Negotiate multiple components, not just base salary

### Advanced Negotiation Example
"I'm thrilled about the opportunity to contribute to [Company]'s mission. Based on my research on levels.fyi and my experience scaling React applications at [Previous Company], I believe the total compensation could be structured as:
- Base: $[X] (within your band for this level)
- Equity: [Y]% over 4 years with standard cliff
- Signing bonus: $[Z] to offset leaving current equity
- Performance bonus: 20% target based on individual and company metrics
This package reflects the value I'll bring to your growth objectives."
