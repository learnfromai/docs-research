The main gap I'm seeing is in the conversion rate - 12% versus our 15% target. That's costing us about $50K in potential revenue.

Here's what I think we should do: Let's get you connected with [expert] to review your pitch approach, and I want to see a 2% improvement by month-end. Sound good? What support do you need to make this happen?"
