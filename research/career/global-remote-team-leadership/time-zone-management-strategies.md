- **Secondary Window**: 4-5 PM PHT (9-10 AM BST, 4-5 AM EDT/1-2 AM PDT, 7-8 PM AEDT)

**Northern Hemisphere Winter (November-February):**
- **Best Global Overlap**: 9-10 AM PHT (1-2 AM GMT, 8-9 PM EST/5-6 PM PST previous day, 12-1 PM AEST)
- **Secondary Window**: 3-4 PM PHT (7-8 AM GMT, 2-3 AM EST/11 PM-12 AM PST previous day, 6-7 PM AEST)
