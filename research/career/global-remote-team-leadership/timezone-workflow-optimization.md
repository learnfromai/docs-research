  project_management:
    planning_cycle:
      - "Weekly planning on Monday morning (Australia + Philippines)"
      - "Mid-week adjustment on Wednesday (UK + Philippines)"
      - "End-week review on Friday (all teams async + selective sync)"
    
    execution_cycle:
      - "Daily standups with regional teams"
      - "Bi-daily async updates to other regions"
      - "Weekly all-hands with rotating optimal times"
      - "Monthly strategic reviews with full global participation"
  
  communication_rhythm:
    high_frequency:
      - "Daily: Australia sync, UK async, US async"
      - "Urgent issues: Multi-channel escalation protocol"
      - "Blockers: Immediate async notification with follow-up"
    
    medium_frequency:
      - "Weekly: UK sync call, US comprehensive update"
      - "Bi-weekly: US sync call (alternating times)"
      - "Monthly: All-team video conference (optimal time rotation)"
    
    low_frequency:
      - "Quarterly: Strategic planning (multi-day async + sync hybrid)"
      - "Annually: Team retreat (in-person or high-production virtual)"
      - "Ad-hoc: Crisis management or major decision points"
