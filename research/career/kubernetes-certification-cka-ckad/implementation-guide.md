# Implementation Guide - Kubernetes Certification Journey

## Strategic Implementation Roadmap

This guide provides a comprehensive, step-by-step approach to successfully obtaining Kubernetes certifications while optimizing for remote work opportunities in AU/UK/US markets.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Assessment (Weeks 1-4)

### Week 1: Current State Assessment

#### Skills Inventory Checklist
```yaml
Prerequisites Assessment:
  Linux Command Line: [ ] Basic [ ] Intermediate [ ] Advanced
  Docker Containers: [ ] Basic [ ] Intermediate [ ] Advanced
  YAML/JSON: [ ] Basic [ ] Intermediate [ ] Advanced
  Git Version Control: [ ] Basic [ ] Intermediate [ ] Advanced
  Networking Concepts: [ ] Basic [ ] Intermediate [ ] Advanced
  Programming (any): [ ] Basic [ ] Intermediate [ ] Advanced

Current Experience Level:
  Container Orchestration: [ ] None [ ] Docker Compose [ ] K8s Basic
  Cloud Platforms: [ ] None [ ] AWS/GCP/Azure Basic [ ] Intermediate
  CI/CD Tools: [ ] None [ ] Basic [ ] Intermediate
  Infrastructure as Code: [ ] None [ ] Basic [ ] Intermediate
```

#### Gap Analysis Framework
```bash
# Self-assessment scoring (1-5 scale)
# 1 = No experience, 5 = Expert level

# Calculate readiness score
LINUX_SCORE=___
DOCKER_SCORE=___
YAML_SCORE=___
NETWORKING_SCORE=___

READINESS_SCORE=$((LINUX_SCORE + DOCKER_SCORE + YAML_SCORE + NETWORKING_SCORE))

# Interpretation:
# 16-20: Ready for CKAD preparation
# 12-15: Need 2-4 weeks foundation building
# 8-11: Need 6-8 weeks intensive preparation
# Below 8: Consider Docker/Linux courses first
```

### Week 2: Environment Setup
