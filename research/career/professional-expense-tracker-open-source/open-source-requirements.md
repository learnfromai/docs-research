- License information
- Contact information

**Note on Nx Bootstrap README**: 
‚úÖ **Keep the Nx-generated README.md** as `NX_BOOTSTRAP_README.md` or `WORKSPACE_SETUP.md` for historical reference and workspace documentation. Create a new comprehensive README.md focused on your expense tracker application.

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone...

```

#### 5. **SECURITY.md** (Recommended)
**Purpose**: Security policy and vulnerability reporting procedures.

**Key Elements**:

- Supported versions
- Vulnerability reporting process
- Security update timeline
- Contact information for security issues

#### 6. **CHANGELOG.md** (Recommended)

```

### GitHub-Specific Files

#### 7. **Issue Templates** (.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/)
**Purpose**: Standardized forms for bug reports and feature requests.

**Required Templates**:

- `bug_report.yml` - Bug reporting form
- `feature_request.yml` - Feature suggestion form
- `question.yml` - General questions and support

#### 8. **Pull Request Template** (.github/pull_request_template.md)
**Purpose**: Standardized PR description and checklist.

**Key Elements**:

- Description of changes
- Testing checklist
- Documentation updates
- Breaking changes notification

#### 9. **GitHub Actions Workflows** (.github/workflows/)
**Purpose**: Automated CI/CD processes.

**Essential Workflows**:

- `ci.yml` - Continuous integration (tests, linting, type checking)
- `release.yml` - Automated releases and versioning
- `security.yml` - Security scanning and dependency checks

### Additional Professional Files

#### 10. **FUNDING.yml** (.github/FUNDING.yml) (Optional)
**Purpose**: Sponsorship and funding options for open source sustainability.

#### 11. **CODEOWNERS** (.github/CODEOWNERS) (Recommended)
**Purpose**: Define code review requirements and maintainer responsibilities.

#### 12. **SUPPORT.md** (Recommended)
**Purpose**: User support channels and resources.

## üéØ Commit Message Standards

### **"feat: initial commit"** - Analysis

**Is "feat: initial commit" okay?**

‚ùå **Not ideal** - Here are better alternatives:

#### Conventional Commits Standard

**Recommended Initial Commit Messages**:

```bash
# Option 1: Simple and clear
git commit -m "chore: initial project setup"

# Option 2: More descriptive
git commit -m "chore: initialize expense tracker monorepo with Nx"

# Option 3: Feature-focused
git commit -m "feat: initialize expense tracker application structure"

# Option 4: Bootstrap-specific
git commit -m "chore: bootstrap Nx workspace for expense tracker"
```

#### Conventional Commit Types

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| `feat` | New features | `feat: add expense categorization` |
| `fix` | Bug fixes | `fix: resolve date picker validation` |
| `docs` | Documentation | `docs: update installation guide` |
| `style` | Code formatting | `style: apply prettier formatting` |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring | `refactor: extract shared utilities` |
| `test` | Testing additions | `test: add expense service unit tests` |
| `chore` | Maintenance tasks | `chore: update dependencies` |
| `ci` | CI/CD changes | `ci: add GitHub Actions workflow` |

### Best Practices for Initial Commits

1. **Use `chore:` for setup** - Initial commits are typically infrastructure/setup
2. **Be descriptive** - Include project name and key technology
3. **Follow team standards** - Establish patterns from the beginning
4. **Consider scope** - Use parentheses for specific areas: `chore(workspace): setup Nx monorepo`
