**Solution**: Limit to 2-3 concurrent topics, complete before moving on

#### **Implementation Gap**
**Problem**: Research without practical application
**Solution**: Require hands-on project for each topic before marking complete

#### **Outdated Information**
**Problem**: Technology evolves rapidly during research
**Solution**: Set 6-month review cycles for updating completed research

#### **Career Misalignment**
**Problem**: Research doesn't match job market or personal goals
**Solution**: Quarterly career goal review and research priority adjustment
