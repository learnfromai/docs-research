# Example: Community Building Question

**Situation**: "When I joined [Company/Community], the developer forum had only 200 active members and low engagement, with most questions going unanswered for days. The engineering team was spending significant time on repetitive support tickets."

**Task**: "I was asked to grow the community and improve developer self-service capabilities, with goals of reaching 1,000 active members and reducing support ticket volume by 30% within six months."

**Action**: "I implemented a three-pronged strategy: First, I created comprehensive FAQ documentation based on common support tickets. Second, I established a community recognition program, highlighting helpful community members weekly. Third, I committed to responding to every question within 4 hours, even if just to acknowledge and provide timeline for full response."

**Result**: "Within six months, we grew to 1,200 active members, achieved 78% community-answered questions, and reduced support tickets by 35%. The engineering team gained 8 hours per week for feature development, and we received positive feedback from 90% of survey respondents about improved support experience."
