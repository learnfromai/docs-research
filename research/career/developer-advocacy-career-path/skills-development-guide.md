**Cross-Timezone Scheduling Strategies:**
```typescript
interface TimezoneManagement {
  optimal_overlap_identification: {
    australia_focus: '9:00 AM - 12:00 PM Philippines = 12:00 PM - 3:00 PM Australia';
    uk_focus: '4:00 PM - 8:00 PM Philippines = 9:00 AM - 1:00 PM UK';
    us_west_coast: 'Limited overlap, async-first approach recommended';
  };
  
  meeting_optimization: {
    preparation: 'Detailed agendas, pre-reading materials, clear objectives';
    execution: 'Efficient facilitation, clear action items, recorded for absent members';
    follow_up: 'Written summaries, decision documentation, progress tracking';
  };
  
  personal_sustainability: {
    boundary_setting: 'Clear availability hours, emergency contact protocols';
    energy_management: 'Strategic scheduling of high-focus work during peak hours';
    health_considerations: 'Regular sleep schedule, exercise, social interaction maintenance';
  };
}
```

## Skill Assessment & Development Tracking

### Self-Assessment Framework

#### Competency Evaluation Tool

```typescript
interface SkillAssessment {
  technical_skills: {
    programming: {
      current_level: 1-10; // Self-assessed proficiency
      target_level: 1-10;  // Required for goals
      evidence: string[];  // Portfolio examples
      development_plan: string; // Specific improvement actions
    };
    
    api_expertise: {
      current_level: 1-10;
      target_level: 1-10;
      evidence: string[];
      development_plan: string;
    };
    
    // ... other technical skills
  };
  
  communication_skills: {
    technical_writing: {
      current_level: 1-10;
      target_level: 1-10;
      evidence: string[]; // Published articles, documentation
      development_plan: string;
    };
    
    public_speaking: {
      current_level: 1-10;
      target_level: 1-10;
      evidence: string[]; // Presentation recordings, speaking engagements
      development_plan: string;
    };
    
    // ... other communication skills
  };
}
```

**Monthly Progress Review Template:**
```yaml
monthly_skill_review:
  achievements:
    technical_growth: 'New technologies learned, projects completed'
    content_creation: 'Articles published, videos created, presentations given'
    community_engagement: 'New connections, helpful contributions, recognition received'
    
  challenges_faced:
    skill_gaps: 'Areas where knowledge was insufficient'
    time_management: 'Balance between learning and output'
    feedback_integration: 'How well feedback was incorporated'
    
  next_month_priorities:
    skill_focus: 'Top 2-3 skills for intensive development'
    output_goals: 'Specific deliverables and deadlines'
    networking_objectives: 'Community engagement and relationship building'
    
  resource_needs:
    learning_materials: 'Courses, books, tools needed'
    mentorship: 'Areas where guidance would be valuable'
    practice_opportunities: 'Speaking, writing, or project opportunities'
```
