## Study Strategy Optimization

### üß† **Learning Methodology**

#### The 70-20-10 Learning Model Applied to AWS Certifications

**70% Hands-on Experience:**
- Build real applications using AWS services
- Implement architectural patterns in practice
- Troubleshoot real-world problems
- Deploy to production environments

**20% Learning from Others:**
- Join AWS study groups and communities

- Find mentors who have completed similar paths

**10% Formal Study:**
- Watch training videos and courses
- Read AWS documentation and whitepapers

#### Active Learning Techniques

**Feynman Technique for AWS Concepts:**
1. **Study** an AWS service or architectural pattern
2. **Explain** it in simple terms to someone else
3. **Identify** gaps in your understanding
4. **Review** and simplify your explanation

**Practical Application:**
```yaml
Example: Explaining Auto Scaling to a Non-Technical Person
Step 1: Study EC2 Auto Scaling documentation
Step 2: "Auto Scaling is like having a smart hiring manager 
        for your servers that automatically adds more servers 
        when busy and removes them when quiet"
Step 3: Realize you don't understand scaling policies deeply
Step 4: Study scaling policies and improve explanation
```

**Spaced Repetition for Service Knowledge:**
- Review key services daily for first week
