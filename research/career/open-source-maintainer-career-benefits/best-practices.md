### Code Quality & Architecture

#### Code Review Standards
```typescript
// ‚úÖ GOOD: Clear, well-documented function with comprehensive error handling
/**
 * Validates user authentication token and returns user profile
 * @param token - JWT authentication token
 * @param options - Configuration options for validation
 * @returns Promise resolving to validated user profile
 * @throws {AuthenticationError} When token is invalid or expired
 * @throws {NetworkError} When external service is unavailable
 */
async function validateUserToken(
  token: string,
  options: ValidationOptions = {}
): Promise<UserProfile> {
  try {
    const decodedToken = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
    const userProfile = await userService.getProfile(decodedToken.userId);
    
    if (!userProfile?.isActive) {
      throw new AuthenticationError('User account is deactivated');
    }
    
    return userProfile;
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof jwt.TokenExpiredError) {
      throw new AuthenticationError('Token has expired');
    }
    throw error;
  }
}

// ‚ùå AVOID: Unclear function with poor error handling
function checkUser(t) {
  return jwt.verify(t, secret);
}
```

#### Testing Excellence
```typescript
// ‚úÖ GOOD: Comprehensive test coverage with edge cases
describe('validateUserToken', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    jest.clearAllMocks();
  });

  it('should return user profile for valid token', async () => {
    // Arrange
    const mockToken = 'valid.jwt.token';
    const mockProfile = { id: '123', email: 'test@example.com', isActive: true };
    jest.spyOn(jwt, 'verify').mockReturnValue({ userId: '123' });
    jest.spyOn(userService, 'getProfile').mockResolvedValue(mockProfile);

    // Act
    const result = await validateUserToken(mockToken);

    // Assert
    expect(result).toEqual(mockProfile);
    expect(jwt.verify).toHaveBeenCalledWith(mockToken, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
    expect(userService.getProfile).toHaveBeenCalledWith('123');
  });

  it('should throw AuthenticationError for expired token', async () => {
    // Arrange
    const expiredToken = 'expired.jwt.token';
    jest.spyOn(jwt, 'verify').mockImplementation(() => {
      throw new jwt.TokenExpiredError('Token expired', new Date());
    });

    // Act & Assert
    await expect(validateUserToken(expiredToken))
      .rejects
      .toThrow(AuthenticationError);
  });

  it('should throw AuthenticationError for deactivated user', async () => {
    // Arrange
    const mockToken = 'valid.jwt.token';
    const deactivatedProfile = { id: '123', email: 'test@example.com', isActive: false };
    jest.spyOn(jwt, 'verify').mockReturnValue({ userId: '123' });
    jest.spyOn(userService, 'getProfile').mockResolvedValue(deactivatedProfile);

    // Act & Assert
    await expect(validateUserToken(mockToken))
      .rejects
      .toThrow('User account is deactivated');
  });
});
```

#### Constructive Feedback Examples
```markdown
## ‚úÖ GOOD: Constructive, Educational Feedback

Great work on implementing this feature! The core logic is solid. I have a few suggestions to improve maintainability:

**Code Organization** (Minor):
Consider extracting the validation logic into a separate function for reusability:

```typescript
// Current approach
if (user.email && user.email.includes('@') && user.email.length > 5) {
  // validation logic
}

// Suggested approach
function isValidEmail(email: string): boolean {
  return email && email.includes('@') && email.length > 5;
}

if (isValidEmail(user.email)) {
  // validation logic
}
```

**Testing** (Important):
Could you add a test case for the scenario where `user.email` is null? This will help prevent regression bugs:

```typescript
it('should handle null email gracefully', () => {
  const user = { email: null };
  expect(() => processUser(user)).not.toThrow();
});
```

**Documentation** (Minor):
The function could benefit from a JSDoc comment explaining the validation rules.

Overall, this is a solid contribution! Once these small changes are addressed, I'm happy to merge. Let me know if you need any clarification.

## ‚ùå AVOID: Unhelpful, Discouraging Feedback

This code is messy and doesn't follow our standards. Please fix it.

The validation logic is wrong.

This will break in production.
