2. **firstnamelastname.com** (Traditional professional)
3. **github-username.dev** (If different from real name)

### Technical Implementation
- **Framework**: Next.js/Gatsby for SEO optimization
- **Hosting**: Vercel/Netlify for automatic deployments
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics + privacy-focused alternatives
- **Performance**: Lighthouse score 90+ across all metrics
```

**Portfolio Website Structure**:
```typescript
// Portfolio website architecture
interface PortfolioSite {
  hero: {
    professional_headline: string;
    value_proposition: string;
    cta_buttons: string[];
    contact_information: ContactInfo;
  };
  about: {
    professional_story: string;
    technical_expertise: string[];
    maintainer_experience: MaintainerHighlight[];
    career_goals: string;
  };
  projects: {

    tutorials: Article[];
  };
  contact: {
    contact_form: boolean;
    calendly_integration: boolean;
    social_links: SocialLink[];
  };
}

const portfolioExample: PortfolioSite = {
  hero: {
    professional_headline: "Open Source Maintainer & Full Stack Engineer",
    value_proposition: "Building scalable developer tools used by 100K+ developers worldwide",
    cta_buttons: ["View Projects", "Schedule Call", "Download Resume"],
