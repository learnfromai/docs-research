# Implementation Guide - CISSP Certification Journey

Step-by-step roadmap for technical professionals pursuing CISSP certification, with specific guidance for Philippines-based candidates targeting international remote work opportunities.

## Phase 1: Pre-Certification Assessment (2-4 weeks)

### üîç Experience Gap Analysis

**Step 1: Map Current Experience to CISSP Domains**

Create a detailed matrix of your current and past roles against the eight CISSP domains:

| Domain | Current Experience | Experience Level | Gap Analysis |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|--------------|
| Security & Risk Management | | Low/Medium/High | Action needed |
| Asset Security | | Low/Medium/High | Action needed |
| Security Architecture | | Low/Medium/High | Action needed |
| Network Security | | Low/Medium/High | Action needed |
| Identity & Access Management | | Low/Medium/High | Action needed |
| Security Assessment | | Low/Medium/High | Action needed |
| Security Operations | | Low/Medium/High | Action needed |
| Software Development Security | | Low/Medium/High | Action needed |

**Step 2: Calculate Total Qualifying Experience**

Document all relevant experience using this template:

```
Position: [Job Title]
Company: [Company Name]
Duration: [Start Date] - [End Date] = [X.X years]
Relevant Domains: [List applicable domains]
Key Security Responsibilities:
- [Specific security-related duty]
- [Compliance or risk management activity] 
- [Security architecture or implementation work]
Total Qualifying Time: [X.X years]
```

**Step 3: Identify Experience Gaps**

- **If < 4 years total**: Plan additional experience building or education substitution
- **If missing domains**: Strategically target roles or projects covering weak areas
- **If 4+ years but weak documentation**: Focus on better evidence gathering
