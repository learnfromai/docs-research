## üìà Skill Development Planning

### Learning Path Optimization

**High-Impact Skills Identification:**
```python
# Skill impact calculation framework
skill_impact_score = (
    market_demand_weight * 0.3 +
    career_goal_alignment * 0.25 +
    current_gap_size * 0.2 +
    learning_difficulty_inverse * 0.15 +
    network_effect_multiplier * 0.1
)

# Example calculation for AWS Skills
aws_skills = {
    'market_demand': 8.5,      # High demand in job market
    'career_alignment': 9.0,   # Critical for target roles
    'current_gap': 6.0,        # Significant gap to close
