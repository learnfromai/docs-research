## Performance and Technical UX Considerations

### Performance-Optimized Learning Experience

**Technical Performance as UX Feature:**

```typescript
interface PerformanceUX {
  // Loading Experience Design
  loadingExperience: {
    initialLoading: {
      splashScreen: 'Branded loading screen with progress indication',
      criticalPath: 'Optimized critical rendering path for faster first paint',
      progressiveLoading: 'Progressive enhancement of interface elements',
      skeletonScreens: 'Content placeholders during loading'
    },
    
    contentLoading: {
      lazyLoading: 'Load content as needed to improve perceived performance',
      imageOptimization: 'Responsive images with appropriate formats (WebP, AVIF)',
      videoStreaming: 'Adaptive bitrate streaming for video content',
      preloading: 'Intelligent preloading of likely next content'
    }
  },
  
  // Responsive Performance
