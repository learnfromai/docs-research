# Topic Prioritization Framework

## üéØ Overview

This framework provides a systematic approach to prioritizing research topics based on career goals, market demand, learning efficiency, and personal interests. Use this methodology to maximize the impact of your research time investment.

## üìä Prioritization Methodology

### üéØ Multi-Factor Scoring System

#### Core Evaluation Criteria

**1. Career Impact Score (Weight: 35%)**
```
Career Impact = (Immediate Value + Long-term Growth + Market Demand) / 3

Immediate Value (1-5):
1 = No immediate application to current role
2 = Minor application, limited impact
3 = Moderate application, noticeable improvement
4 = Significant application, substantial improvement
5 = Critical application, transformative impact

Long-term Growth (1-5):
1 = Limited future relevance
2 = Occasional future application
3 = Moderate future value
4 = High long-term importance
5 = Essential for career progression

Market Demand (1-5):
1 = Niche skill, limited opportunities
2 = Specialized skill, moderate demand
3 = Growing skill, good opportunities
4 = High demand skill, many opportunities
5 = Critical skill, essential for market competitiveness
```

**2. Learning Efficiency Score (Weight: 25%)**
```
Learning Efficiency = (Prior Knowledge + Resource Quality + Time Investment) / 3

Prior Knowledge (1-5):
1 = Completely new domain, steep learning curve
2 = Some related experience, moderate difficulty
3 = Solid foundation, manageable learning curve
4 = Strong background, straightforward learning
5 = Expert foundation, quick mastery possible

Resource Quality (1-5):
1 = Limited resources, poor documentation
2 = Basic resources, adequate documentation
3 = Good resources, solid documentation
4 = Excellent resources, comprehensive guides
5 = Outstanding resources, expert-level content

Time Investment (Reverse Score 1-5):
1 = 20+ hours required for competency
2 = 15-20 hours required
3 = 10-15 hours required
4 = 5-10 hours required
5 = 2-5 hours required
```

**3. Personal Interest Score (Weight: 20%)**
```
Personal Interest = (Curiosity + Passion + Alignment) / 3

Curiosity (1-5):
1 = No interest, feel obligated to learn
2 = Mild interest, practical necessity
3 = Moderate interest, intellectually engaging
4 = High interest, genuinely excited
5 = Extreme interest, can't wait to explore

Passion (1-5):
1 = Would avoid if possible
2 = Neutral, neither excited nor resistant
3 = Somewhat passionate, willing to invest time
4 = Highly passionate, enjoy learning process
5 = Extremely passionate, intrinsically motivated

Alignment (1-5):
1 = Conflicts with personal values/interests
2 = Neutral alignment, no strong connection
3 = Good alignment with interests
4 = Strong alignment with passions
5 = Perfect alignment with life goals
```

**4. Strategic Value Score (Weight: 20%)**
```
Strategic Value = (Differentiation + Foundation + Innovation) / 3

Differentiation (1-5):
1 = Common skill, no competitive advantage
2 = Moderately common, slight advantage
3 = Somewhat rare, good differentiation
4 = Rare skill, significant advantage
5 = Extremely rare, major competitive edge

Foundation (1-5):
1 = Narrow application, limited transferability
2 = Some transferability to related areas
3 = Good foundation for multiple skills
4 = Strong foundation, enables many other skills
5 = Critical foundation, prerequisite for advancement

Innovation (1-5):
1 = Established technology, no innovation potential
2 = Mature technology, limited innovation
3 = Evolving technology, moderate innovation
4 = Emerging technology, high innovation potential
5 = Cutting-edge technology, breakthrough potential
```

### üìà Scoring Calculation

#### Final Priority Score Formula
```
Priority Score = (Career Impact √ó 0.35) + (Learning Efficiency √ó 0.25) + 
                (Personal Interest √ó 0.20) + (Strategic Value √ó 0.20)

Result Range: 1.0 to 5.0
```

#### Priority Categories
```
High Priority: 4.0 - 5.0
- Immediate research candidates
- Maximum 3-5 topics at a time

Medium Priority: 3.0 - 3.9
- Secondary research queue
- Research after high priority completion

Low Priority: 2.0 - 2.9
- Future consideration
- Research during low-demand periods

Deferred: 1.0 - 1.9
- Postpone indefinitely
- Reconsider only if circumstances change significantly
```
