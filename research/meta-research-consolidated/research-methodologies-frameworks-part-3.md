## 🎯 Topic Prioritization Frameworks

### Strategic Alignment Assessment

#### Business Value Scoring

**Revenue Impact (1-5 scale):**
* 5: Direct revenue generation or significant cost savings
* 4: Indirect revenue impact through efficiency or quality improvements
* 3: Supports revenue-generating activities or processes
* 2: Minimal direct business impact but strategic value
* 1: Personal interest or academic value only

**Career Advancement (1-5 scale):**
* 5: Critical for next career milestone or role transition
* 4: Highly valuable for current role enhancement
* 3: Useful for future opportunities and skill diversification
* 2: Nice-to-have for professional development
* 1: Optional learning without clear career benefit

**Market Demand (1-5 scale):**
* 5: High demand across multiple industries and companies
* 4: Growing demand in target industry or specialization
* 3: Stable demand with consistent job opportunities
* 2: Niche demand in specific contexts or companies
* 1: Limited or declining market demand

#### Implementation Feasibility

**Resource Requirements (1-5 scale, lower is better):**
* 1: Can be implemented with existing skills and tools
* 2: Requires minimal additional learning or investment
* 3: Moderate learning curve or resource investment needed
* 4: Significant time, money, or skill development required
* 5: Major investment with uncertain return timeline

**Technical Complexity (1-5 scale, lower is better):**
* 1: Simple concepts with straightforward implementation
* 2: Moderate complexity requiring focused learning
* 3: Complex but manageable with structured approach
* 4: High complexity requiring significant expertise
* 5: Cutting-edge or experimental with limited resources

### Prioritization Matrix Calculation

**Priority Score = (Business Value + Career Advancement + Market Demand) / Resource Requirements × Technical Complexity**

**Interpretation:**
* **Score > 3.0**: High priority, immediate implementation
* **Score 2.0-3.0**: Medium priority, schedule within 3 months
* **Score 1.5-2.0**: Lower priority, consider for future planning
* **Score < 1.5**: Defer or eliminate unless strategic importance
