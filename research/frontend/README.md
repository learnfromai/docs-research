## Research Areas

### üöÄ Performance Analysis
- **[Performance Analysis](performance-analysis/README.md)** - Comprehensive research on frontend performance optimization, measurement tools (Lighthouse, PageSpeed Insights), and React/Vite enhancement strategies

### ‚öõÔ∏è React/Next.js Production Patterns
- **[Open Source React/Next.js Projects Research](open-source-react-nextjs-projects/README.md)** - Comprehensive analysis of 25+ production-ready React and Next.js projects, covering state management, authentication, UI patterns, and real-world implementation strategies

## Research Overview

Our frontend technology research focuses on practical performance improvements and measurement strategies that can be immediately applied to modern web applications. The research emphasizes evidence-based optimization techniques with measurable results.

Our frontend research focuses on:

1. **Performance First** - Optimizing for real-world performance metrics
2. **Production Patterns** - Learning from successful open source projects
3. **Scalability** - Solutions that work as projects grow
4. **Developer Experience** - Tools and patterns that improve productivity
5. **Modern Standards** - Current best practices and emerging trends

### Key Research Highlights

**Open Source Project Analysis:**
- Analyzed 25+ production React/Next.js applications including Cal.com, Plane, Supabase, Vercel Commerce
- Documented real-world state management patterns with Zustand, Redux Toolkit, and Context API
- Comprehensive authentication strategies from NextAuth.js, Supabase Auth, and custom JWT implementations
- Component library management approaches from Mantine, Chakra UI, and primitive-based systems
- Production-ready templates and code examples for immediate implementation

**Performance Research:**
- Lighthouse vs PageSpeed Insights comparison and setup guides
- React/Vite performance optimization techniques
- Bundle analysis and optimization strategies
