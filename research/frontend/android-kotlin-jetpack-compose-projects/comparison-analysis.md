#### Code Comparison Example:

**Traditional Views (XML + Java/Kotlin):**
```xml
<!-- layout.xml -->
<LinearLayout
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    android:orientation="vertical">
    
    <TextView
        android:id="@+id/titleText"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:text="@string/title" />
    
    <Button
        android:id="@+id/actionButton"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:text="@string/action" />
        
</LinearLayout>
```

```kotlin
// Activity/Fragment
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)
        
        val titleText = findViewById<TextView>(R.id.titleText)
        val actionButton = findViewById<Button>(R.id.actionButton)
        
        actionButton.setOnClickListener {
            titleText.text = "Button clicked!"
        }
    }
}
```

**Jetpack Compose:**
```kotlin
@Composable
fun MainScreen() {
    var title by remember { mutableStateOf("Title") }
    
    Column {
        Text(text = title)
        Button(
            onClick = { title = "Button clicked!" }
        ) {
            Text("Action")
        }
    }
}
```
