## Business Case for EdTech Applications

### Market Opportunity
- **Philippine EdTech Market**: Growing demand for professional licensure exam preparation
- **Global Remote Work**: High demand for micro-frontend expertise in AU, UK, US markets
- **Competitive Advantage**: Rapid feature development and market adaptation capabilities

### Strategic Benefits
1. **Team Scalability**: Independent development teams for different subjects (nursing, engineering, accounting)
2. **Technology Flexibility**: Mix optimal technologies for different use cases (React for interactivity, Vue for admin)
3. **Deployment Velocity**: Deploy exam modules independently without affecting core platform
4. **Market Testing**: A/B test different educational approaches at the application level
5. **Global Expansion**: Adapt quickly to different market requirements and regulations

## Technical Recommendations

### Primary Architecture: Module Federation
**Recommendation**: Webpack 5 Module Federation with React ecosystem

#### Why Module Federation?
- ✅ **Runtime Composition**: Dynamic loading of educational modules based on user subscriptions
- ✅ **Shared Dependencies**: Efficient sharing of React, UI libraries across applications
- ✅ **Independent Deployments**: Deploy new exam modules without platform downtime
- ✅ **Team Independence**: Different teams can own different educational domains
- ✅ **Performance**: Code splitting and lazy loading optimal for mobile-first Philippine market

#### Implementation Stack
```typescript
// Recommended Technology Stack
Container App: React 18 + TypeScript + React Router
Micro-frontends: React + Module Federation
State Management: Zustand (lightweight) + React Query (server state)
UI Components: Shared design system via federated components
Build: Webpack 5 + Module Federation Plugin
Deployment: Docker containers + independent CI/CD pipelines
```

### Alternative Approaches Evaluated

#### Single-SPA: Maximum Flexibility
- **Best For**: Complex legacy integration, multiple framework coexistence
- **Drawbacks**: Higher complexity, steeper learning curve
- **EdTech Fit**: Overkill for greenfield educational platform

#### Nx Micro-frontends: Monorepo Approach
- **Best For**: Single organization, shared codebase preferences
- **Drawbacks**: Less team independence, build-time coupling
- **EdTech Fit**: Good for smaller teams, less suitable for independent scaling

#### Web Components: Framework Agnostic
- **Best For**: Long-term technology migration, framework independence
- **Drawbacks**: Limited ecosystem, browser compatibility concerns
- **EdTech Fit**: Promising for future, not ready for production EdTech needs
