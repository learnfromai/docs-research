## Quick Reference

### Micro-Frontend Approaches Comparison

| Approach | Complexity | Framework Support | Performance | Team Independence | Learning Curve |
|----------|------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Module Federation** | Medium | React, Vue, Angular | High | High | Medium |
| **Single-SPA** | High | All Frameworks | High | Very High | High |
| **Nx Micro-frontends** | Low | React, Angular | High | Medium | Low |
| **Web Components** | Medium | Framework Agnostic | Medium | High | Medium |
| **Build-time Integration** | Low | All | Very High | Low | Low |

### Technology Stack Recommendations

#### For EdTech Platforms
```typescript
// Primary Stack
- Container App: React 18 + TypeScript
- Micro-frontends: React/Vue.js with Module Federation
- State Management: Zustand/Redux Toolkit for shared state
- Routing: React Router with micro-frontend coordination
- UI Components: Shared design system via Module Federation
- Testing: Jest + React Testing Library + Cypress E2E
- Build Tools: Webpack 5 with Module Federation Plugin
- Deployment: Docker containers with independent CI/CD pipelines
```

#### Communication Patterns
```typescript
// Event-driven Communication
- Custom Events API for cross-app messaging
- Shared Event Bus for complex workflows
- Props/Callbacks for parent-child communication
- Shared State Management for global application state
```

### Implementation Decision Matrix

#### Choose Module Federation When:
- ✅ Need runtime composition of applications
- ✅ Teams use similar technology stacks (React, Vue, Angular)
- ✅ Require sharing of libraries and components
- ✅ Need independent deployment capabilities
- ✅ Have strong webpack expertise on team

#### Choose Single-SPA When:
- ✅ Need maximum framework flexibility
- ✅ Legacy application integration required
- ✅ Complex routing and lifecycle management needed
- ✅ Multiple framework coexistence required
- ✅ Long-term technology migration strategy

#### Choose Nx Micro-frontends When:
- ✅ Monorepo approach preferred
- ✅ Strong tooling and developer experience priority
- ✅ Team coordination and shared code important
- ✅ Consistent technology stack across teams
- ✅ Build-time optimization preferred over runtime
