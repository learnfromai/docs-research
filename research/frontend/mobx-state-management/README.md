## 🚀 Quick Reference

### Technology Stack Recommendations

| Component | Recommended Solution | Alternatives | Notes |
|-----------|---------------------|--------------|-------|
| **State Management** | MobX 6.x | Redux Toolkit, Zustand | Best for complex, interconnected state |
| **React Integration** | mobx-react-lite | mobx-react | Hooks-based approach for modern React |
| **TypeScript Support** | Built-in types | Custom type definitions | Excellent TypeScript support out of the box |
| **DevTools** | MobX DevTools | Redux DevTools | Specialized debugging for observable state |
| **Testing** | Jest + @testing-library | Enzyme | Works well with standard React testing tools |
| **Build Tool** | Vite/Webpack | Create React App | Requires decorator/observable transpilation |

### Key Decision Factors

✅ **Choose MobX When:**
- Complex state relationships and derived data
- Need automatic dependency tracking
- Want minimal boilerplate code
