## Quick Reference

### RxJS Core Concepts Overview

| Concept | Purpose | Key Use Cases | Performance Impact |
|---------|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Observable** | Data stream representation | Event handling, async operations | Low overhead when properly managed |
| **Subject** | Multicast observable | Event bus, state management | Moderate - shared subscriptions |
| **BehaviorSubject** | Observable with current value | State management, caching | Higher memory usage for state storage |
| **ReplaySubject** | Observable that replays values | Caching, late subscribers | High memory usage - stores history |
| **Hot Observable** | Shares execution | WebSocket, DOM events | Efficient for multiple subscribers |
| **Cold Observable** | Individual execution | HTTP requests, timers | Can create multiple executions |

### Essential Operators by Category

| Category | Operators | Primary Use | Learning Priority |
|----------|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| **Creation** | `of`, `from`, `fromEvent`, `interval` | Observable creation | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Critical |
| **Transformation** | `map`, `switchMap`, `mergeMap`, `concatMap` | Data transformation | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Critical |
| **Filtering** | `filter`, `take`, `skip`, `distinctUntilChanged` | Data filtering | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Critical |
| **Combination** | `combineLatest`, `merge`, `zip`, `forkJoin` | Stream coordination | ‚≠ê‚≠ê Important |
| **Error Handling** | `catchError`, `retry`, `retryWhen` | Resilience | ‚≠ê‚≠ê Important |
| **Utility** | `tap`, `delay`, `timeout`, `finalize` | Debugging, timing | ‚≠ê Helpful |

### Framework Integration Summary

| Framework | Integration Pattern | State Management | Performance Considerations |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------|---------------------------|
| **React** | Custom hooks, useEffect cleanup | External state (Zustand + RxJS) | Careful subscription management |
| **Angular** | Built-in AsyncPipe, Services | Reactive services pattern | Built-in optimization |
| **Vue.js** | Composition API, reactive refs | Pinia + RxJS integration | Manual subscription handling |
| **Vanilla JS** | Direct subscription management | RxJS as primary state layer | Full control over performance |

### EdTech Application Patterns

| Use Case | RxJS Pattern | Implementation Priority | Complexity |
|----------|-------------|------------------------|------------|
| **Real-time Quiz** | WebSocket + Subject | High | Medium |
| **Progress Tracking** | BehaviorSubject + Storage | High | Low |
| **User Input Debouncing** | debounceTime + switchMap | High | Low |
| **Data Synchronization** | combineLatest + retry | Medium | High |
| **Offline Capability** | merge + catchError | Medium | High |
| **Analytics Streaming** | buffer + merge | Low | Medium |
