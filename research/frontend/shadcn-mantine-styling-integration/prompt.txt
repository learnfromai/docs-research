[Research] Conduct a research on how to utilize shadncn/radix-ui as CSS library but will have style inspiration from mantine or antd, etc.

Is it as simple as exploring the codebase for those component libraries and checking their styling? How to achieve them? I want the freedom of shadcn/tailwind for my own custom ui library since in the end, I can just copy and paste the components. However, I kind of like the existing styling of mantine components for example. I kind of don't like the styling of shadcn ui so I will still customize it to fit my liking.
