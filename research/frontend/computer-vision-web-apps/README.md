# Computer Vision in Web Applications

## üìñ Project Overview

This research provides comprehensive documentation on implementing computer vision and image processing systems in web applications. Specifically designed for EdTech platforms targeting Philippine licensure exam reviews with considerations for global deployment and remote work opportunities in AU, UK, and US markets.

Computer vision in web applications enables powerful features like document scanning, handwriting recognition, image analysis, and interactive learning experiences directly in the browser without requiring server-side processing.
