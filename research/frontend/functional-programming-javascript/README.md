# Functional Programming in JavaScript - Comprehensive Research

## üéØ Overview

This comprehensive research explores Functional Programming (FP) concepts, libraries, and practical applications in JavaScript, specifically tailored for developers targeting remote work opportunities in AU, UK, and US markets, with particular focus on edtech platform development.

Functional Programming represents a paradigm shift towards writing more predictable, testable, and maintainable code through immutability, pure functions, and declarative programming patterns that are increasingly valued in modern JavaScript development.

## üöÄ Quick Reference

### Functional Programming Concepts Summary

| Concept | Description | JavaScript Example | Use Cases |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Pure Functions** | Functions with no side effects, same input = same output | `const add = (a, b) => a + b` | Predictable calculations, testing |
| **Immutability** | Data structures that don't change after creation | `const newArray = [...oldArray, newItem]` | State management, concurrent programming |
| **Higher-Order Functions** | Functions that take or return other functions | `array.map(fn)`, `array.filter(fn)` | Data transformation, composition |
| **Currying** | Breaking down functions into single-argument functions | `const multiply = a => b => a * b` | Function reuse, partial application |
| **Composition** | Combining simple functions to build complex operations | `compose(f, g, h)(x)` | Code organization, reusability |
| **Monads** | Containers for values with transformation methods | `Maybe`, `Either`, `IO` | Error handling, async operations |

### JavaScript FP Libraries Comparison

| Library | Size | Learning Curve | Performance | Best For | GitHub Stars |
|---------|------|----------------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| **Ramda** | ~60KB | Steep | Good | Data transformation, composition | 23.8k+ |
| **Lodash/FP** | ~70KB | Moderate | Excellent | Utility functions, familiar API | 59.8k+ |
| **Immutable.js** | ~63KB | Moderate | Excellent | Complex state management | 32.9k+ |
| **RxJS** | ~130KB | Steep | Good | Reactive programming, async | 30.8k+ |
| **Sanctuary** | ~45KB | Very Steep | Good | Type-safe FP, algebraic structures | 3.0k+ |
