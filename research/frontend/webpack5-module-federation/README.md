## ⚡ Quick Reference

### Technology Stack Comparison

| Approach | Bundle Size | Development Experience | Runtime Performance | Team Autonomy | Learning Curve |
|----------|-------------|----------------------|-------------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Module Federation** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Single-SPA | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ |
| Nx Micro-frontends | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Bit Components | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |

### Module Federation Key Benefits
- **Runtime Code Sharing** - Share dependencies and components at runtime, reducing bundle duplication
- **Independent Deployments** - Deploy micro-frontends independently without affecting other applications
- **Technology Flexibility** - Different teams can use different versions of libraries and frameworks
- **Scalable Architecture** - Supports large-scale applications with multiple development teams
- **Performance Optimization** - Dynamic imports and shared chunks optimize loading performance

### EdTech Platform Considerations
- **Content Module Isolation** - Different educational content areas as separate federated modules
- **Shared Design System** - Consistent UI components shared across all learning modules
- **Progressive Loading** - Load educational content modules on-demand for better performance
- **Multi-tenant Architecture** - Support for different educational institutions with shared infrastructure
- **Analytics Integration** - Centralized analytics while maintaining module autonomy
