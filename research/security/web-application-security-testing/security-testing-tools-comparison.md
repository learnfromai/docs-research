- **Tier 1 Stack ($500/year)**: Prevents 60% of common vulnerabilities
- **Tier 2 Stack ($6,000/year)**: Prevents 80% of vulnerabilities
- **Tier 3 Stack ($40,000/year)**: Prevents 95% of vulnerabilities

**ROI Calculation**:
```
ROI = (Prevented Breach Cost - Security Investment) / Security Investment

Tier 1: ($3.79M * 0.6 - $500) / $500 = 4,539% ROI
Tier 2: ($3.79M * 0.8 - $6,000) / $6,000 = 504% ROI  
Tier 3: ($3.79M * 0.95 - $40,000) / $40,000 = 890% ROI
```

### Business Impact Benefits
- **Customer Trust**: 25% increase in enterprise customer acquisition
- **Insurance Costs**: 15-30% reduction in cybersecurity insurance premiums  
- **Compliance**: Faster SOC 2 certification process
- **Developer Productivity**: 20% reduction in security-related bugs
