## üöÄ Quick Reference

### Open Source Project Essentials Checklist

| Category | Essential Items | Status |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| **Legal & Licensing** | LICENSE file, Copyright notices, Third-party compliance | ‚úÖ Documented |
| **Package.json Setup** | Author info, License field, Repository links, Keywords | ‚úÖ Documented |
| **Root Directory Files** | README, CHANGELOG, Project manifest for age tracking | ‚úÖ Documented |
| **Community Infrastructure** | Contributing guide, Code of conduct, Issue templates | ‚úÖ Documented |
| **Quality Assurance** | CI/CD pipeline, Testing strategy, Security scanning | ‚úÖ Documented |
| **Documentation** | API docs, Usage examples, Development setup | ‚úÖ Documented |

### Project Age Tracking Solution

**Problem**: Need unchanging root files to track project age from "feat: initial commit"

**Solution**: Create a `PROJECT_MANIFEST.json` file with:
```json
{
  "project": {
    "name": "project-name",
    "created": "2025-01-XX",
    "version": "0.0.0",
    "type": "nx-monorepo"
  }
}
```

### Recommended Technology Stack

| Category | Technology | Purpose | Open Source Considerations |
|----------|------------|---------|---------------------------|
| **Monorepo** | Nx, Lerna | Workspace management | Strong OSS community, good documentation |
| **Package Management** | npm, yarn, pnpm | Dependency management | Publishing to npm registry |
| **Build Tools** | TypeScript, ESBuild, SWC | Compilation & bundling | Fast builds, wide compatibility |
| **Testing** | Jest, Vitest, Playwright | Quality assurance | Industry standard, good CI integration |
| **Documentation** | Typedoc, Docusaurus, Storybook | API & component docs | Professional documentation sites |
| **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions, GitLab CI | Automation | Free for open source projects |
