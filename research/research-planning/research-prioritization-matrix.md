# Research Prioritization Matrix: Decision Framework for Topic Selection

A comprehensive framework for evaluating, prioritizing, and selecting research topics based on impact, effort, timing, and strategic alignment with career and business objectives.

## ðŸŽ¯ Prioritization Framework Overview

### Multi-Dimensional Evaluation Model

The research prioritization matrix uses four key dimensions to evaluate potential research topics:

1. **Impact Score** - Potential value and benefit
2. **Effort Score** - Required investment and complexity
3. **Timing Score** - Market relevance and urgency
4. **Alignment Score** - Strategic fit with goals

**Final Priority Score = (Impact Ã— 0.4) + (Timing Ã— 0.3) - (Effort Ã— 0.2) + (Alignment Ã— 0.1)**
