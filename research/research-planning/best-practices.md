# Best Practices: Research Methodology and Execution

Comprehensive best practices for conducting effective research sessions, maintaining quality standards, and maximizing learning outcomes from technical and business research.

## üéØ Research Planning Best Practices

### Pre-Research Preparation

#### 1. Clear Objective Definition
**Best Practice**: Define specific, measurable research outcomes before starting
- **Do**: "Research TypeScript advanced patterns to implement type-safe APIs in our current project"
- **Don't**: "Learn more about TypeScript"
- **Why**: Specific objectives lead to focused research and measurable outcomes

#### 2. Time Boxing and Scheduling
**Best Practice**: Allocate fixed time blocks with clear start/end times
- **Recommended**: 2-4 hour focused sessions with 15-minute breaks every hour
- **Schedule**: Consistent weekly slots for sustained momentum
- **Buffer**: Add 25% time buffer for unexpected discoveries

#### 3. Resource Gathering
**Best Practice**: Collect initial sources and tools before deep research begins
- Bookmark relevant documentation and tutorials
- Set up development environments and testing spaces
- Prepare note-taking and documentation templates
- Identify expert sources and community resources

### Research Scope Management

#### 4. Structured Research Questions
**Best Practice**: Use the 5W+1H framework for comprehensive coverage
- **Who**: Target audience, experts, stakeholders
- **What**: Specific technologies, concepts, implementations
- **When**: Timeline, version considerations, adoption cycles
- **Where**: Context, environments, use cases
- **Why**: Business value, technical benefits, problem solving
- **How**: Implementation details, step-by-step processes

#### 5. Depth vs Breadth Balance
**Best Practice**: Follow the T-shaped learning approach
- **Breadth**: Survey the entire landscape first (20% of time)
- **Depth**: Deep-dive into most relevant areas (60% of time)
- **Integration**: Connect learnings to existing knowledge (20% of time)

## üìö Information Quality and Validation

### Source Credibility Assessment

#### 6. Source Hierarchy and Validation
**Best Practice**: Prioritize sources by credibility and recency
1. **Primary Sources** (Highest credibility)
   - Official documentation and APIs
   - Original research papers and studies
   - Direct expert interviews

2. **Secondary Sources** (Medium credibility)
   - Technical tutorials from reputable sources
   - Community-driven documentation
   - Conference presentations and workshops

3. **Tertiary Sources** (Lowest credibility)
   - Blog posts and opinion pieces
   - Social media discussions
   - Unverified community content

#### 7. Information Triangulation
**Best Practice**: Validate findings through multiple independent sources
- Cross-reference information across 3+ sources
- Test code examples and implementations personally
- Seek expert review when possible
- Document conflicting information and investigate further

### Citation and Documentation Standards

#### 8. Comprehensive Citation Management
**Best Practice**: Document all sources with context and retrieval information
```markdown
