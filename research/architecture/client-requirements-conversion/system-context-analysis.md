### Conversion Patterns

#### Client Requirement Translation
```
Client Statement: "I want users to be able to update their profile information"

API-First Analysis:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Service Endpoint: PUT /api/users/{userId}/profile
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Data Contract: Profile update request/response schemas
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Validation Rules: Field validation and business rule enforcement
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Error Handling: HTTP status codes for various failure scenarios
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Security: Authentication token validation and authorization
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Performance: Response time and throughput requirements
```

#### EARS Template Preferences
```yaml
API_First_EARS_Patterns:
  Most_Common: "Event-driven (WHEN request... THE SYSTEM SHALL respond...)"
  Secondary: "Unwanted Behavior (IF invalid data... THEN return error...)"
  Performance: "Ubiquitous (THE SYSTEM SHALL process within X seconds)"
  Security: "Ubiquitous (THE SYSTEM SHALL validate authentication)"
  
Example_Templates:
  - "WHEN client sends POST to /api/auth/login with valid credentials"
  - "THE SYSTEM SHALL return HTTP 200 with JWT token within 2 seconds"
  - "IF request body is malformed THEN return HTTP 400 with validation errors"
```

### API-First Requirements Deep Dive

#### Data Contract Focus
```markdown
# API-First: Login Feature Requirements

## Request/Response Specifications
WHEN client sends POST request to /api/auth/login with JSON body containing email and password
THE SYSTEM SHALL validate request format and return appropriate response within 2 seconds

### Request Schema Requirements:
{
  "email": "string (required, valid email format)",

WHILE user session is active
THE SYSTEM SHALL validate session tokens on each backend request, refresh frontend authentication state, and extend session expiration by 30 minutes

WHEN session expires due to inactivity

## Data Consistency Requirements
WHEN user profile data changes during active session
THE SYSTEM SHALL update backend database, refresh frontend user context, invalidate relevant caches, and maintain session validity

WHEN concurrent login attempts occur for same user
THE SYSTEM SHALL handle race conditions properly, maintain data integrity, and provide consistent user experience

## Integrated Error Handling
WHEN login fails due to invalid credentials

WHEN network connectivity issues occur during login
THE SYSTEM SHALL detect connection problems, provide user feedback, implement retry logic, and maintain form state for recovery

WHEN backend services are unavailable during login attempt
THE SYSTEM SHALL detect service unavailability, display maintenance message, implement graceful degradation, and log incidents for monitoring
