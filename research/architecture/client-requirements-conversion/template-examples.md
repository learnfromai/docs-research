# Template Examples: Login and Registration Requirements Conversion

## üéØ Overview

This document provides complete worked examples of converting the specific client requirements provided in the research request into structured user stories with acceptance criteria and precise EARS requirements. Each example demonstrates the conversion process across different system contexts (API-first, UI-only, integrated).

## üìã Original Client Requirements

**Requirement 1**: *"I want to have a login feature where user can log in with email/username and password."*

**Requirement 2**: *"I want to have a register feature where user can create new account with first name, last name, email and password, and the username is by default the username of the email so it won't be included in the register form."*

## üîê Example 1: Login Feature Conversion

### Stage 1: Requirements Analysis

#### Element Extraction
```yaml
Client_Statement: "I want to have a login feature where user can log in with email/username and password"

Extracted_Elements:
  Primary_Actor: "Users (registered application users)"
  Core_Action: "Authentication/Login"
  Authentication_Methods: 
    - "Email address"
    - "Username" 
  Authentication_Factor: "Password"
  Context: "User access control system"
  Goal: "Secure access to protected application features"

Implicit_Requirements:
  - User account must exist before login attempt
  - System must validate credentials against stored data
  - Successful authentication grants access to protected areas
  - Failed authentication must be handled securely
  - Session management required post-authentication
  - Security measures needed (rate limiting, encryption)

Assumptions:
  - Registration system exists or will be implemented
  - Both email and username are unique identifiers
  - Password security standards will be enforced
  - Session/token management system is available
  - User interface for login interaction exists
```

### Stage 2: User Story Creation


# User Story: User Authentication

**As a** registered user of the application
**I want** to log in using either my email address or username along with my password
**So that** I can securely access my personal account and use protected features

**Story Points**: 5
**Priority**: Must Have (MoSCoW)
**Epic**: User Management
**Dependencies**: User registration system, password hashing service, session management

## Acceptance Criteria

### Happy Path Scenarios

**Given** I am a registered user on the login page
**When** I enter my valid email address and correct password
**Then** I should be authenticated successfully
**And** I should be redirected to my dashboard within 3 seconds
**And** I should see a welcome message confirming my identity

**Given** I am a registered user on the login page  
**When** I enter my valid username and correct password
**Then** I should be authenticated successfully
**And** I should be redirected to my dashboard within 3 seconds
**And** I should see a welcome message confirming my identity

### Error Scenarios

**Given** I am on the login page
**When** I enter an email address that doesn't exist in the system
**Then** I should see "Invalid email/username or password" error message
**And** I should remain on the login page
**And** the system should not reveal whether the email exists or not

**Given** I am on the login page
**When** I enter a valid email but incorrect password
**Then** I should see "Invalid email/username or password" error message
**And** I should remain on the login page
**And** the failed attempt should be logged for security monitoring

**Given** I have made 4 failed login attempts
**When** I make a 5th failed login attempt
**Then** my account should be temporarily locked for 15 minutes
**And** I should see "Too many failed attempts. Account locked for 15 minutes" message
**And** I should receive an email notification about the account lockout

### Edge Cases

**Given** I am already logged in from another browser/device
**When** I log in again from a different location
**Then** I should have the option to continue with multiple sessions or end other sessions
**And** I should receive a security notification about the new login

**Given** my password was recently changed
**When** I try to log in with my old password
**Then** I should see "Password recently changed. Please use your new password" message
**And** I should be redirected to password reset if needed

### Non-Functional Requirements

**And** my username should be automatically generated from the part of my email before the @ symbol
**And** I should receive a confirmation email with account verification link
**And** I should be redirected to a "Check your email" confirmation page

**Given** I have received the verification email
**When** I click the verification link
**Then** my account should be activated
**And** I should be redirected to the login page with a "Account verified successfully" message

### Error Scenarios

**Given** I am on the registration page
**When** I enter an email address that already exists in the system
**Then** I should see "This email address is already registered. Please use a different email or try logging in." message

**Given** I am filling out the registration form
**When** I enter a password that doesn't meet security requirements (less than 8 characters, no uppercase, no numbers)
**Then** I should see specific password requirement messages in real-time
**And** the submit button should remain disabled until requirements are met

**Given** I am on the registration page
**When** I leave required fields (first name, last name, email, password) empty
**Then** I should see "This field is required" messages for each empty field
**And** I should not be able to submit the form

### Edge Cases

**Given** I enter an email with a very short prefix (like "a@example.com")
**When** my account is created
**Then** my username should be generated as "a" or with additional characters to meet minimum length requirements
**And** the system should handle potential username conflicts appropriately

**Given** multiple users try to register with emails that would generate the same username
**When** registration occurs simultaneously
**Then** the system should handle username conflicts by appending numbers (user1, user2, etc.)
**And** all registrations should complete successfully without data conflicts

**Given** I am registering during high traffic periods
**When** I submit my registration
**Then** the system should handle the registration within 10 seconds
**And** I should receive appropriate feedback if processing takes longer than expected

```

### Lessons Learned from Examples

1. **Context Matters**: Same user story produces significantly different EARS requirements based on system implementation approach
2. **Implicit Requirements**: Client statements contain many unstated assumptions that must be made explicit
3. **Security by Default**: Authentication features require comprehensive security considerations beyond basic functionality
4. **Error Scenarios Critical**: Happy path is only ~30% of total requirements; error handling dominates specification
5. **Performance Specifications**: Vague client requirements need specific, measurable performance criteria

## üéØ Template Reusability

These examples serve as templates for similar authentication requirements across different projects. Key reusable patterns include:

- **Authentication Flow Patterns**: Login/logout sequences adaptable to different systems
- **Validation Logic**: Email, password, and form validation requirements
- **Security Measures**: Rate limiting, account lockout, and encryption standards
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error scenarios for authentication failures
- **Performance Criteria**: Realistic timing and throughput expectations
