- [ ] Identify key stakeholders for validation
- [ ] Establish requirement quality criteria
- [ ] Set up documentation structure and tools
- [ ] Prepare conversion templates and worksheets

## 🔄 The Three-Stage Conversion Process

### Stage 1: Requirements Analysis

#### Step 1.1: Requirement Decomposition

**Objective**: Break down client statements into structured elements

**Process**:
1. **Extract Core Elements**
   ```
   Client Statement: "I want a login feature where users can log in with email/username and password"
   
   Analysis:
   - Actor: Users
   - Action: Log in 
   - Method: Email/username and password
   - Context: Authentication system
   - Goal: Access the application
   ```

2. **Identify Implicit Elements**
   ```
   Implicit Requirements:
   - Security: Password protection required
   - Validation: Email/username format checking
   - Feedback: Success/failure messages
   - Session: Post-login state management
   - Error Handling: Invalid credentials scenarios
   ```

3. **Document Assumptions**
   ```
   Assumptions:
   - Users have existing accounts or can register
   - System supports both email and username login
   - Password meets security requirements
   - Session management is required post-login
   ```

#### Step 1.2: Context Analysis

**System Context Questions**:
- Is this an API-first implementation (backend service)?
- Is this UI-only (frontend consuming existing API)?
- Is this integrated (full-stack implementation)?
- What are the integration requirements?
- What are the security and compliance needs?

**Context Documentation Template**:
```yaml
Context_Analysis:
  Implementation_Type: "API-first | UI-only | Integrated"
  Primary_Users: ["End users", "API consumers", "Administrators"]
  Integration_Points: ["User database", "Session store", "Email service"]
  Security_Requirements: ["Authentication", "Authorization", "Data protection"]
  Performance_Expectations: ["Response time", "Concurrent users", "Availability"]
```

#### Step 1.3: Stakeholder Validation

**Validation Questions**:
1. What does success look like for this feature?
2. What are the most important error scenarios to handle?
3. Are there any regulatory or compliance requirements?
4. What are the performance expectations?
5. How does this integrate with existing systems?

**Validation Output**:
```markdown
# Stakeholder Validation Results

## Business Owner Feedback:
- Primary goal: Secure user access to personalized features
- Success metric: 95% successful login rate
- Error priority: Clear messaging for failed attempts

## Technical Lead Input:
- Integration: Existing user database and session management
- Security: OAuth 2.0 compatible, password hashing required
- Performance: <3 second response time for authentication

## User Experience Considerations:
- Accessibility: Screen reader compatible
- Usability: Remember me functionality preferred
- Mobile: Responsive design required
```

### Stage 2: User Story Creation

#### Step 2.1: Apply User Story Format

**Standard Template**:
```markdown
**As a** [specific user type]
**I want** [specific functionality]
**So that** [specific business benefit]
```

**Example Application**:
```markdown
# User Story: User Authentication

**As a** registered user of the application
**I want** to log in using my email/username and password
**So that** I can access my personalized account and secure features

**Story Points**: 5
**Priority**: Must Have (MoSCoW)
**Epic**: User Management
```

#### Step 2.2: Create Acceptance Criteria

**Template Structure**:
```markdown
## Acceptance Criteria

### Happy Path Scenarios
**Given** [precondition]
**When** [user action]
**Then** [expected outcome]

### Error Scenarios
**Given** [error condition]
**When** [trigger action]
**Then** [error handling]

### Edge Cases
**Given** [boundary condition]
**When** [edge case trigger]
**Then** [edge case handling]
```

**Example Application**:
```markdown
## Acceptance Criteria

### Happy Path Scenarios
**Given** I am on the login page and have a valid account
**When** I enter correct email/username and password
**Then** I should be authenticated and redirected to my dashboard within 3 seconds

**Given** I am logging in from a new device
**When** I provide valid credentials
**Then** I should receive an optional security notification email

### Error Scenarios
**Given** I am on the login page
**When** I enter an invalid email format
**Then** I should see "Please enter a valid email address" validation message

**Given** I am on the login page
**When** I enter incorrect credentials
**Then** I should see "Invalid email/username or password" error message
**And** the system should not reveal which field was incorrect

**Given** I have entered incorrect credentials 5 times
**When** I attempt to log in again
**Then** my account should be temporarily locked for 15 minutes
**And** I should see a lockout notification message

### Edge Cases
**Given** I am already logged in from another session
**When** I log in again from a different device
**Then** I should have the option to end other sessions or continue with multiple sessions

**Given** my account password was recently changed
**When** I try to log in with the old password
**Then** I should see "Password recently changed, please use your new password" message
```

#### Step 2.3: Story Validation and Prioritization

**Quality Checklist**:
- [ ] Story follows standard format (As a... I want... So that...)
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are specific and measurable
- [ ] All major scenarios covered (happy path, errors, edge cases)
- [ ] Business value is clear and aligned with stakeholder goals
- [ ] Story is appropriately sized (can be completed in one sprint)

**Prioritization Criteria**:
```markdown
# Story Prioritization Matrix

## Business Value (1-5)
- User impact: How many users affected?
- Revenue impact: Direct business value?
- Strategic alignment: Supports key objectives?

## Technical Complexity (1-5)
- Implementation effort: Development time required?
- Integration complexity: Dependencies on other systems?
- Risk level: Technical uncertainties or challenges?

## Dependencies (1-5)
- Blocking stories: Must be completed first?
- External dependencies: Third-party integrations?
- Resource availability: Team capacity and skills?
```

### Stage 3: EARS Specification

#### Step 3.1: Convert to EARS Format

**EARS Template Patterns**:
```markdown
# EARS Template Selection Guide

## Event-driven (most common for user actions)
WHEN [specific trigger condition]
THE SYSTEM SHALL [specific response behavior]

## Unwanted Behavior (error handling)
IF [error condition occurs]
THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL [error response behavior]

## State-driven (continuous behaviors)
WHILE [system state condition]
THE SYSTEM SHALL [continuous behavior]

## Ubiquitous (always applicable)
THE SYSTEM SHALL [always-true requirement]

## Optional (conditional features)
WHERE [feature condition]
THE SYSTEM SHALL [conditional behavior]

## Complex (multiple conditions)
IF [condition1] THEN WHEN [condition2]
THE SYSTEM SHALL [complex response]
```

#### Step 3.2: Apply System Context

**API-First Context Example**:
```markdown
# EARS Requirements: Login API

## Authentication Endpoint
WHEN a client sends POST request to /api/auth/login with valid email and password
THE SYSTEM SHALL return HTTP 200 with JWT token and user profile within 2 seconds

WHEN a client sends authentication request with invalid credentials
THE SYSTEM SHALL return HTTP 401 with error code AUTH_INVALID_CREDENTIALS

WHEN a client sends authentication request with malformed email
THE SYSTEM SHALL return HTTP 400 with validation error details

## Rate Limiting
WHEN a client makes more than 5 failed authentication attempts within 15 minutes
THE SYSTEM SHALL return HTTP 429 and block further attempts for 15 minutes

## Security
THE SYSTEM SHALL hash passwords using bcrypt with minimum 12 rounds
THE SYSTEM SHALL generate JWT tokens with 24-hour expiration
THE SYSTEM SHALL log all authentication attempts with IP address and timestamp
```

**UI-Only Context Example**:
```markdown
# EARS Requirements: Login Interface

## Form Behavior
WHEN a user loads the login page
THE SYSTEM SHALL display email/username field, password field, and login button

WHEN a user enters text in the email field
THE SYSTEM SHALL validate email format in real-time and show feedback

WHEN a user submits the login form with valid credentials
THE SYSTEM SHALL show loading indicator and redirect to dashboard upon success

## Error Display
WHEN login fails due to invalid credentials
THE SYSTEM SHALL display "Invalid email/username or password" above the form

WHEN network error occurs during login
THE SYSTEM SHALL display "Connection error, please try again" with retry button

## Accessibility
THE SYSTEM SHALL provide proper ARIA labels for all form fields
THE SYSTEM SHALL support keyboard navigation through all interactive elements
THE SYSTEM SHALL announce form validation errors to screen readers
```

**Integrated Context Example**:
```markdown
# EARS Requirements: Login Feature (Full-Stack)

## Authentication Flow
WHEN a user submits login form with valid credentials
THE SYSTEM SHALL authenticate against user database, create session, and redirect to dashboard within 3 seconds

WHEN authentication succeeds
THE SYSTEM SHALL update last login timestamp and send optional security notification email

## Error Handling
WHEN user enters invalid credentials
THE SYSTEM SHALL increment failed attempt counter, display error message, and maintain secure session state

WHEN account lockout threshold is reached
THE SYSTEM SHALL temporarily disable account, notify user, and send unlock instructions via email

## Session Management
WHILE user session is active
THE SYSTEM SHALL validate session token on each request and extend expiration by 30 minutes

WHEN user session expires due to inactivity
THE SYSTEM SHALL redirect to login page and display "Session expired, please log in again" message
```

#### Step 3.3: Add Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance Requirements**:
```markdown
## Performance EARS Requirements

THE SYSTEM SHALL respond to authentication requests within 2 seconds under normal load
THE SYSTEM SHALL support 1000 concurrent authentication requests without degradation
THE SYSTEM SHALL maintain 99.9% availability during business hours
```

**Security Requirements**:
```markdown
## Security EARS Requirements

THE SYSTEM SHALL encrypt all authentication data in transit using TLS 1.3
THE SYSTEM SHALL never log or store passwords in plaintext
THE SYSTEM SHALL invalidate sessions after 24 hours of inactivity
THE SYSTEM SHALL implement CSRF protection for all authentication endpoints
```

**Usability Requirements**:
```markdown
## Usability EARS Requirements

THE SYSTEM SHALL provide clear error messages without revealing system internals
THE SYSTEM SHALL support password managers and browser autofill
THE SYSTEM SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
```
