# Client Requirements Conversion to User Stories and EARS Requirements

Comprehensive research on converting vague client requirements into structured user stories with acceptance criteria (ACs) and precise EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) requirements ready for development implementation. This guide provides practical workflows, templates, and system-specific approaches for requirements conversion.

## Quick Reference

### Client Requirements Conversion Process

| Stage | Input | Output | Key Activities |
|-------|-------|--------|----------------|
| **Analysis** | Vague client requirements | Structured requirement elements | Identify actors, actions, constraints, and context |
| **User Stories** | Requirement elements | User stories with acceptance criteria | Apply user story format with measurable ACs |
| **EARS Specification** | User stories with ACs | EARS-formatted requirements | Convert to WHEN/SHALL format with system responses |

### Example Conversion Flow
```
Client: "I want a login feature"
    ‚Üì
User Story: "As a user, I want to log in with email/password so that I can access my account"
    ‚Üì
EARS: "WHEN a user submits valid login credentials, THE SYSTEM SHALL authenticate and redirect to dashboard within 3 seconds"
```

### System Context Approach

| Context | Focus | Key Considerations |
|---------|-------|-------------------|
| **API-First** | Data contracts and service behavior | Request/response formats, error codes, performance |
| **UI-Only** | User interactions and interface behavior | User experience, validation feedback, accessibility |
| **Integrated** | End-to-end workflows | Frontend-backend coordination, data flow, consistency |

### Conversion Quality Criteria

```
‚úÖ Specificity: Clear, unambiguous language
‚úÖ Testability: Measurable acceptance criteria
‚úÖ Completeness: Happy path, errors, and edge cases covered
‚úÖ Traceability: Clear connection from client need to technical specification
‚úÖ Context Alignment: Appropriate for chosen system implementation approach
```

### Technology Stack for Requirements Conversion

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| Documentation | Markdown + YAML | Structured requirements capture and versioning |
| Templates | JSON Schema | Standardized conversion formats and validation |
| Validation | Custom Scripts | Quality assurance and completeness checking |
| Integration | JIRA/Azure DevOps | Requirements tracking and development handoff |
| Collaboration | Miro/Figma | Visual workflow mapping and stakeholder alignment |
