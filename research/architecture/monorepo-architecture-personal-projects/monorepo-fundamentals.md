# Monorepo Fundamentals for Personal Projects

## Introduction

A monorepo (monolithic repository) is a software development strategy where code for many projects is stored in the same repository. For personal projects like the Expense Tracker MVP, this approach offers unique advantages in code sharing, development efficiency, and AI coding agent optimization.

## Monorepo vs Multi-repo Analysis

### Monorepo Advantages

#### 1. **Unified Development Experience**
- Single codebase to clone, set up, and maintain
- Consistent tooling, linting, and formatting across all projects
- Shared development scripts and build processes
- Simplified dependency management

#### 2. **Code Reusability and Sharing**
- Easy sharing of business logic between frontend and backend
- Shared TypeScript types across all services
- Common UI components library for web and mobile
- Unified API client libraries

#### 3. **Atomic Changes Across Services**
- Single commit can update multiple services simultaneously
- Breaking changes are immediately visible across the entire project
- Easier refactoring across service boundaries
- Simplified feature development spanning multiple services

#### 4. **AI Coding Agent Optimization**
- Complete project context visible to coding agents
- Better code suggestions based on entire project understanding
- Cross-service pattern recognition and consistency
- Enhanced code generation with full context awareness

#### 5. **Simplified Tooling and Configuration**
- Single CI/CD pipeline for all services
- Unified testing strategy and configuration
- Shared development environment setup
- Consistent Docker and deployment configurations

### Multi-repo Disadvantages for Personal Projects

#### 1. **Context Switching Overhead**
- Multiple repositories to manage and keep in sync
- Separate development environments for each service
- Individual dependency updates across repositories
- Fragmented knowledge and documentation

#### 2. **Code Duplication and Drift**
- Business logic duplication between services
- Type definitions maintained separately
- Inconsistent implementations of common patterns
- Difficulty maintaining consistency across services

#### 3. **Complex Cross-Service Changes**
- Multiple PRs required for feature changes
- Coordination overhead for breaking changes
- Version management complexity
- Integration testing challenges

#### 4. **Limited AI Agent Context**
- Coding agents see only partial project context
- Reduced effectiveness in cross-service suggestions
- Pattern recognition limited to single repositories
- Fragmented understanding of project architecture

## When to Choose Monorepo for Personal Projects

### Ideal Scenarios

#### 1. **Multi-Platform Applications**
```
Expense Tracker Example:
├── Web PWA (React/Next.js)
├── Mobile App (React Native)
├── Admin Dashboard (React)
├── API Backend (Express.js)
├── Lambda Microservices
└── E2E Testing Suite
```

#### 2. **Shared Business Logic**
- Complex domain models used across services
- Common validation rules and business rules
- Shared data transformations and calculations
- Cross-platform utility functions

#### 3. **Rapid Development and Iteration**
- Solo developer or small team (1-3 developers)
- Frequent feature changes across multiple services
- Need for quick prototyping and experimentation
- Strong emphasis on development velocity

#### 4. **TypeScript-Heavy Projects**
- Strong typing requirements across services
- Shared interface definitions
- Complex data models with relationships
- API contract enforcement

### Scenarios to Avoid Monorepo

#### 1. **Completely Independent Services**
- Services with no shared code or business logic
- Different technology stacks with no commonality
- Independent release cycles with no coordination
- Separate team ownership with different practices

#### 2. **Large Team Development**
- Teams larger than 10-15 developers
- Multiple autonomous product teams
- Different deployment cadences and requirements
- Strong team boundaries with minimal collaboration

## Core Monorepo Principles

### 1. **Clear Package Boundaries**

#### Domain-Driven Organization
```
packages/
├── shared-types/          # Cross-service type definitions
├── business-logic/        # Core domain logic
├── ui-components/         # Shared UI library
├── api-client/           # Service communication
├── validation/           # Shared validation rules
└── utilities/            # Common utility functions
```

#### Service-Specific Packages
```
apps/
├── web-pwa/              # React PWA application
├── mobile/               # React Native application
├── api-gateway/          # Main Express.js backend
└── admin-dashboard/      # Administrative interface

services/
├── auth-service/         # Authentication microservice
├── expense-service/      # Core expense management
├── notification-service/ # Notification handling
└── analytics-service/    # Data analytics and reporting
```

### 2. **Dependency Management Strategy**

#### Shared Dependencies
- Common development tools (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript)
- Shared runtime libraries (React, Express, testing frameworks)
- Build tools and bundlers (Webpack, Vite, Rollup)

#### Package-Specific Dependencies
- Service-specific libraries and frameworks
- Deployment-specific tools and configurations
- Performance and optimization libraries

#### Internal Package Dependencies
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@expense-tracker/shared-types": "*",
    "@expense-tracker/business-logic": "*",
    "@expense-tracker/api-client": "*"
  }
}
```

### 3. **Build and Development Optimization**

#### Incremental Builds
- Only rebuild changed packages and their dependents
- Intelligent caching of build artifacts
- Parallel execution of independent builds
- Watch mode for development efficiency

#### Development Workflow
```bash
# Start all services in development mode
npm run dev

# Run tests for affected packages only
npm run test:affected

# Build only changed packages
npm run build:affected

# Run E2E tests with all services
npm run e2e
```

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### 1. **Build Performance**

#### Challenge
Large monorepos can have slow build times as the project grows.

#### Solutions
- **Incremental Builds**: Only build changed packages
- **Build Caching**: Cache build artifacts locally and remotely
- **Parallel Execution**: Run independent builds in parallel
- **Selective Testing**: Run tests only for affected packages

#### Implementation Example
```typescript
// nx.json configuration
{
  "tasksRunnerOptions": {
    "default": {
      "runner": "@nrwl/workspace/tasks-runners/default",
      "options": {
        "cacheableOperations": ["build", "test", "lint"],
        "parallel": 3
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. **Dependency Hell**

#### Challenge
Managing dependencies across multiple packages can lead to version conflicts.

#### Solutions
- **Workspace-Level Dependencies**: Share common dependencies at workspace root
- **Dependency Constraints**: Enforce consistent versions across packages
- **Automated Updates**: Use tools like Renovate or Dependabot
- **Selective Updates**: Update dependencies incrementally with testing

#### Implementation Example
```json
// package.json workspace configuration
{
  "workspaces": [
    "apps/*",
    "packages/*",
    "services/*"
  ],
  "devDependencies": {
    "typescript": "^5.0.0",
    "react": "^18.0.0",
    "express": "^4.18.0"
  }
}
```

### 3. **Team Coordination**

#### Challenge
Multiple developers working on the same repository can cause conflicts.

#### Solutions
- **Clear Ownership**: Define package ownership and responsibilities
- **Branch Strategies**: Use feature branches and protected main branch
- **Code Review**: Require reviews for changes affecting multiple packages
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear architecture and contribution guidelines

### 4. **Deployment Complexity**

#### Challenge
Deploying multiple services from a single repository can be complex.

#### Solutions
- **Independent Deployments**: Deploy services independently based on changes
- **Containerization**: Use Docker for consistent deployments
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Manage deployment infrastructure with Terraform
- **Blue-Green Deployments**: Enable zero-downtime deployments
