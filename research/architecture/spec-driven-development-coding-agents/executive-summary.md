# Executive Summary: Spec-Driven Development with Coding Agents

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Findings

Based on comprehensive analysis of AWS Kiro's specification approach and coding agent capabilities, spec-driven development provides a structured methodology for transforming project ideas into implemented software through three distinct phases:

### Core Methodology: Three-Phase Workflow

**Phase 1: Requirements** (`requirements.md`)
- User stories written in EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) notation
- Clear, testable conditions using "WHEN... THE SYSTEM SHALL..." format
- Structured acceptance criteria for each requirement
- Direct translation to test cases and validation

**Phase 2: Design** (`design.md`)
- Technical architecture and system design
- Data flow diagrams and component interactions
- Interface specifications and API definitions
- Implementation considerations and constraints

**Phase 3: Implementation** (`tasks.md`)
- Discrete, trackable tasks with clear outcomes
- Task dependencies and execution order
- Progress tracking and completion validation
- Handoff points between different coding agents

## ðŸ“Š AWS Kiro Analysis: The Gold Standard

### Kiro's Specification Philosophy

AWS Kiro pioneered the spec-driven approach by recognizing that **structured specifications bridge the gap between conceptual product requirements and technical implementation details**. The methodology eliminates the common problem of requirements getting lost in translation between product managers and engineers.

### Key Innovations from Kiro

1. **EARS Notation**: Structured requirements syntax that eliminates ambiguity
2. **Iterative Refinement**: Specs evolve with implementation feedback
3. **Agent-Friendly Format**: Structured data that coding agents can parse and execute
4. **Version Control Integration**: Specifications as code, stored alongside implementation
5. **Multi-Project Sharing**: Specs can be shared across teams and repositories
