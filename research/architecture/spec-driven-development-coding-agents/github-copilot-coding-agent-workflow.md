- **Independent Components**: Tasks that can be developed simultaneously
- **Shared Dependencies**: Components that require coordination
- **Integration Points**: Where components must work together
- **Testing Strategy**: How to test components individually and together

### Quality Optimization

#### Specification-Driven Testing

**Test Case Generation:**
```markdown
## Test Strategy Based on Specifications

### Requirements-Based Tests
For each acceptance criterion:
```typescript
// Example: User registration requirement
// "WHEN user submits valid registration data THEN system creates account"

describe('User Registration', () => {
  it('should create account with valid data', async () => {
    const validUser = {
      email: 'test@example.com',
      password: 'SecureP@ss1', 
      name: 'Test User'
    };
    
    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/api/auth/register')
      .send(validUser)
      .expect(201);
    
    expect(response.body.success).toBe(true);
    expect(response.body.data.message).toBe('Please check your email to verify your account');
  });
});
```

### Design-Based Tests
For each API endpoint specification:
```typescript
// Example: API contract testing
describe('POST /api/auth/register API Contract', () => {
  it('should return exact response format from specification', async () => {
    // Test matches design.md specification exactly
    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/api/auth/register')
      .send(validRegistrationData);
    
    expect(response.status).toBe(201);
    expect(response.body).toMatchSchema(registrationResponseSchema);
  });
});
```
```

#### Performance Validation

**Performance Testing Based on Requirements:**
```javascript
// Example: Performance requirement validation
// "System shall respond to authentication requests within 200ms for 95% of requests"

describe('Authentication Performance', () => {
  it('should meet response time requirements', async () => {
    const startTime = Date.now();
    
    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/api/auth/login')
      .send(validCredentials);
    
    const responseTime = Date.now() - startTime;
    expect(responseTime).toBeLessThan(200); // 200ms requirement
    expect(response.status).toBe(200);
  });
});
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting and Optimization

### Common Implementation Issues

#### Specification Ambiguity Resolution

**Issue**: Coding agent requests clarification on ambiguous requirements

**Solution Approach:**
1. **Immediate Clarification**: Provide specific, unambiguous guidance
2. **Specification Update**: Update original specifications to prevent future ambiguity
3. **Template Improvement**: Enhance templates to avoid similar issues

**Example Response Format:**
```markdown
## Clarification Response

### Original Ambiguity
"User authentication should be secure"

### Specific Clarification
Implement authentication using:
- JWT tokens with 15-minute expiration
- bcrypt password hashing with 12 salt rounds
- Rate limiting: 5 attempts per 15 minutes per IP
- Account lockout: 30 minutes after 5 failed attempts

### Implementation Details
```typescript
// Specific code example for implementation
const hashPassword = async (password: string): Promise<string> => {
  return await bcrypt.hash(password, 12);
};
```

### Updated Specification
[Update the original specification with this clarification]
```

#### Performance and Scalability Issues

**Issue**: Implementation doesn't meet performance requirements

**Resolution Process:**
1. **Requirement Review**: Verify performance targets in specifications
2. **Implementation Analysis**: Identify performance bottlenecks
3. **Optimization Strategy**: Propose specific improvements
4. **Validation Testing**: Confirm improvements meet requirements

### Continuous Improvement

#### Implementation Feedback Loop

**Feedback Collection:**
```markdown
## Implementation Review

### Specification Quality Assessment
- **Clarity**: Were requirements clear and unambiguous?
- **Completeness**: Were all necessary details provided?
- **Implementation Readiness**: Could coding agent implement without clarification?

### Coding Agent Performance  
- **First-Pass Success**: Percentage of tasks completed correctly on first attempt
- **Clarification Requests**: Number and type of clarifications needed

- **Specification Enhancements**: What additional detail would be beneficial?
- **Workflow Optimizations**: How can handoff process be improved?
```

#### Template Evolution

**Specification Template Updates:**
Based on implementation feedback, continuously improve:
- **Requirements Templates**: Add sections that reduce clarification needs
- **Design Templates**: Include more implementation-specific details
- **Task Templates**: Enhance acceptance criteria and implementation guidance
