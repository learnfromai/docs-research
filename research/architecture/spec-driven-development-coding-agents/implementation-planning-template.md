# Implementation Planning Template

## üìã Overview

This template provides a structured approach to breaking down requirements and design specifications into actionable implementation tasks optimized for coding agents. The planning template bridges the gap between high-level specifications and granular development work.

## üéØ Purpose

**Goal**: Transform requirements and design documents into detailed task lists that coding agents can execute autonomously with minimal clarification.

**Key Benefits**:
- **Task Clarity**: Each task has clear acceptance criteria and definition of done
- **Dependency Tracking**: Explicit dependencies between tasks enable proper sequencing
- **Progress Monitoring**: Structured format enables automated progress tracking
- **Agent Optimization**: Tasks formatted for optimal handoff to coding agents

## üìä Task Prioritization Framework

### Priority Levels

#### Must Have (P0)
- **Criteria**: Core functionality required for MVP
- **Examples**: User authentication, basic CRUD operations, critical security features
- **Timeline**: Must be completed in current phase

#### Should Have (P1)
- **Criteria**: Important features that significantly enhance user experience
- **Examples**: Advanced search, notifications, user preferences
- **Timeline**: Should be completed in current release if time permits

#### Could Have (P2)
- **Criteria**: Nice-to-have features that add value but aren't essential
- **Examples**: Advanced analytics, integration with non-critical services
- **Timeline**: Can be deferred to future releases

#### Won't Have (P3)
- **Criteria**: Features explicitly out of scope for current release
- **Examples**: Future enhancements, advanced features requiring more research
- **Timeline**: Not planned for current development cycle

## üîó Dependency Management

### Dependency Types

#### Technical Dependencies
```markdown
**Technical Dependencies**: 
- Database schema (TASK-001) must be completed before model implementation (TASK-002)
- Authentication service (TASK-003) required before protected endpoints (TASK-004)
```

#### Resource Dependencies
```markdown
**Resource Dependencies**:
- External API keys and configuration required
- Third-party service setup (SendGrid, Stripe, etc.)
- Infrastructure provisioning and deployment setup
```

#### Knowledge Dependencies
```markdown
**Knowledge Dependencies**:
- Research into specific technology or approach needed
- Design decisions pending stakeholder approval
- Performance benchmarking results required
```

### Dependency Visualization

#### Clear and Specific
- ‚úÖ **Good**: "Implement user registration endpoint with email validation, password hashing, and verification email sending"
- ‚ùå **Bad**: "Add user signup functionality"

#### Testable Outcomes
- ‚úÖ **Good**: "API returns 201 status code with user ID when valid data provided"
- ‚ùå **Bad**: "Registration works correctly"

#### Appropriately Sized
- ‚úÖ **Good**: Single feature or component (4-8 hours work)
- ‚ùå **Bad**: Entire module or system (20+ hours work)

#### Implementation-Ready
- ‚úÖ **Good**: Includes specific technical requirements and constraints
- ‚ùå **Bad**: Vague descriptions requiring interpretation

### Estimation Guidelines

#### Effort Estimation Factors
- **Complexity**: How difficult is the implementation?
- **Dependencies**: How many other components are involved?
- **Testing**: How much test coverage is required?
- **Documentation**: What documentation needs to be created/updated?

#### Time Allocation Guidelines
- **Simple CRUD**: 2-4 hours
- **Complex Business Logic**: 4-8 hours  
- **External Integration**: 6-12 hours
- **Security Implementation**: 8-16 hours
- **Testing Suite**: 25-50% of implementation time
- **Documentation**: 10-20% of implementation time
