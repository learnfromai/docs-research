# AWS Kiro Specification Analysis

## üìã Overview

AWS Kiro represents the state-of-the-art in spec-driven development with coding agents. This analysis examines Kiro's methodology, file structures, and best practices to understand how to implement similar workflows with other coding agents like Claude Code and GitHub Copilot.

## üéØ Kiro's Core Philosophy

### The Specification-First Approach

Kiro's fundamental insight is that **specifications bridge the gap between conceptual product requirements and technical implementation details**. Rather than jumping directly from user stories to code, Kiro enforces a structured three-phase workflow:

1. **Requirements Phase**: Structured user stories with acceptance criteria
2. **Design Phase**: Technical architecture and implementation planning  
3. **Implementation Phase**: Task-based execution with progress tracking

### Key Innovation: Agent-Friendly Specifications

Unlike traditional documentation written for human consumption, Kiro's specifications are designed to be **machine-readable and actionable by AI agents**. This enables autonomous code generation while maintaining human oversight and control.

## üèóÔ∏è Kiro's Three-Phase Workflow

### Phase 1: Requirements Definition

**File**: `.kiro/specs/feature-name/requirements.md`

**Purpose**: Transform vague feature requests into structured, testable requirements using EARS notation.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Every requirement follows EARS format: `WHEN [condition] THE SYSTEM SHALL [behavior]`
- User stories include clear acceptance criteria
- Edge cases and error conditions explicitly covered
- Requirements are independently testable

**Example Structure from Kiro**:
```markdown
# Feature Requirements

## User Story: User Authentication

### US-001: User Login
**As a** registered user  
**I want** to log into the system with my credentials  
**So that** I can access my personalized dashboard

#### Acceptance Criteria
WHEN a user enters valid email and password
THE SYSTEM SHALL authenticate the user and redirect to dashboard

WHEN a user enters invalid credentials  
THE SYSTEM SHALL display "Invalid email or password" and retain the email field

WHEN a user fails authentication 3 times consecutively
THE SYSTEM SHALL lock the account for 15 minutes and display lockout message
```

### Phase 2: Design Documentation

**File**: `.kiro/specs/feature-name/design.md`

**Purpose**: Translate requirements into technical architecture and implementation strategy.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Architecture diagrams using Mermaid syntax
- Data model specifications with relationships
- API endpoint definitions with request/response formats
- Sequence diagrams for complex interactions
- Security and performance considerations

**Example Structure from Kiro**:
```markdown
# Authentication Design

## Architecture Overview
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant API as API Gateway  
    participant Auth as Auth Service
    participant DB as Database
    
    U->>API: POST /auth/login
    API->>Auth: ValidateCredentials
    Auth->>DB: FindUser
    DB-->>Auth: User data
    Auth-->>API: JWT token
    API-->>U: 200 OK with token
```

## Data Model
- User entity with email, password hash, lockout fields
- Session tracking for failed attempts
- JWT token structure and claims

## Security Implementation
- bcrypt password hashing with salt
- JWT token with 15-minute expiration
- Rate limiting: 5 attempts per IP per minute
```

### Phase 3: Implementation Planning

**File**: `.kiro/specs/feature-name/tasks.md`

**Purpose**: Break down the design into discrete, executable tasks for coding agents.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Tasks are granular (1-2 days maximum)
- Clear acceptance criteria for each task
- Dependencies between tasks identified
- Progress tracking with completion status

**Example Structure from Kiro**:
```markdown
# Authentication Implementation Tasks
