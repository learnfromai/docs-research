  - [ ] How does this feature fit into the broader product strategy?

User_Research:
  - [ ] User personas and their pain points identified
  - [ ] User journeys and workflows mapped
  - [ ] Current state analysis completed
  - [ ] Competitive analysis reviewed
  - [ ] User feedback and requirements gathered

Technical_Context:
  - [ ] Development approach determined (API-first, UI-first, integration)
  - [ ] Technology stack and constraints identified

```

#### Discovery Session Template
```markdown

```

### Step 2: Define User Personas and Roles
Create specific, realistic user personas rather than generic roles.

#### Persona Development Template
```markdown
# User Persona: [Persona Name]

## Demographics and Context
- **Role/Title**: [Specific job title or user type]
- **Experience Level**: [Novice/Intermediate/Expert with relevant systems]

```

## Phase 2: User Story Development

### Step 3: Write Initial User Stories
Follow the structured approach to create well-formed user stories.

#### User Story Writing Checklist
```yaml
Story_Structure:
  - [ ] Starts with "As a [specific role/persona]"
  - [ ] Includes "I want [clear, actionable capability]"
  - [ ] Ends with "So that [concrete business value/benefit]"
  - [ ] Uses specific persona names rather than generic "user"
  - [ ] Focuses on user value rather than technical implementation

Story_Quality:
  - [ ] Independent: Can be developed separately from other stories
  - [ ] Negotiable: Details can be discussed and refined
  - [ ] Valuable: Provides clear business or user value
  - [ ] Estimable: Development effort can be reasonably estimated
  - [ ] Small: Can be completed within a single sprint
  - [ ] Testable: Success can be objectively verified
```

#### Story Writing Workshop Process
```markdown
# Story Writing Workshop: [Feature Name]

   - Focus on different personas and use cases
   - No discussion or evaluation during writing

2. **Story Sharing** (20 minutes)
   - Each participant shares their stories
   - Group similar stories together
   - Note unique perspectives and edge cases

3. **Story Refinement** (40 minutes)
   - Combine and refine similar stories
   - Ensure stories meet INVEST criteria
   - Prioritize stories by business value and technical feasibility

4. **Story Validation** (20 minutes)
   - Review stories against business objectives
   - Confirm stories address all key user needs
   - Identify any missing scenarios or edge cases
```

### Step 4: Prioritize and Size Stories
Organize stories by priority and estimate effort required.

## Phase 3: Acceptance Criteria Development

### Step 5: Develop Acceptance Criteria
Transform user stories into testable conditions using the Given-When-Then format.

#### Acceptance Criteria Writing Process
```markdown
# Acceptance Criteria Development Process

## 1. Identify Scenarios
For each user story, identify:
- **Happy Path**: The main successful user journey
- **Alternative Paths**: Valid alternative ways to accomplish the goal
- **Error Paths**: What happens when things go wrong
- **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions and unusual situations

## 2. Write Scenarios in Given-When-Then Format
- **Given**: Preconditions and context
- **When**: The action or event that triggers the behavior
- **Then**: The expected outcome or system response

## 3. Include Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance expectations
- Security requirements
- Accessibility standards
- Usability criteria
```

#### Acceptance Criteria Template
```gherkin
# User Story: [Story Title]

## Happy Path Scenarios

Scenario: [Scenario Name]
  Given [precondition/context]
  When [user action or trigger]
  Then [expected outcome]
  And [additional expected outcome]

## Alternative Path Scenarios

Scenario: [Alternative Scenario Name]
  Given [different precondition]
  When [alternative action]
  Then [alternative outcome]

## Error Path Scenarios

Scenario: [Error Scenario Name]
  Given [error condition setup]
  When [action that triggers error]
  Then [error handling behavior]
  And [recovery options provided]

## Non-Functional Requirements

## Phase 4: EARS Notation Requirements

### Step 7: Convert to EARS Notation
Transform acceptance criteria into detailed, unambiguous technical requirements.

#### EARS Template Selection Guide
```markdown
# EARS Template Selection Decision Tree

## Event-Driven (WHEN...THE system SHALL...)
Use when describing system responses to specific triggers or user actions.
- User interactions (clicks, form submissions)
- System events (data received, timer expired)
- External triggers (API calls, messages)

## Unwanted Behavior (IF...THEN the system SHALL...)
Use when describing error handling and exception scenarios.
- Input validation failures
- Security violations
- System failures or timeouts
- Data inconsistencies

## State-Driven (WHILE...THE system SHALL...)
Use when describing continuous or ongoing system behavior.
- Background processes
- Monitoring and maintenance activities
- Session management
- Data synchronization

## Ubiquitous (The system SHALL...)
Use when describing requirements that always apply.
- Security policies
- Data protection requirements
- Performance standards
- Compliance requirements

## Optional (WHERE...THE system SHALL...)
Use when describing conditional functionality.
- Feature toggles
- Environment-specific behavior
- Optional integrations
- Configuration-dependent features

## Complex (IF...THEN WHEN...THE system SHALL...)
Use when describing multi-condition requirements.
- Workflow dependencies
- Complex business rules
- Multi-step processes
- Cascading system behaviors
```

#### EARS Requirements Development Process
```markdown
# EARS Requirements Development Process

## 3. Ensure Traceability
Maintain clear links:
- Each EARS requirement traces to specific acceptance criteria
- Each acceptance criterion traces to user story
- Business value remains clear throughout hierarchy

## 4. Validate Technical Feasibility
Confirm with development team:
- Requirements are technically implementable
- Resource estimates are reasonable
- Dependencies are identified and manageable
