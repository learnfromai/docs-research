## Quick Reference

### User Story Framework
```
As a [specific user role]
I want [clear capability or feature]
So that [concrete business value or benefit]
```

### Requirements Progression
```yaml
User_Story: 
  focus: "User perspective and business value"
  audience: "Product owners, stakeholders, users"
  detail_level: "High-level capability description"

Acceptance_Criteria:
  focus: "Testable conditions and scenarios"
  audience: "Developers and testers"
  detail_level: "Behavioral specifications"

EARS_Notation:
  focus: "System behavior and technical requirements"
  audience: "Developers and system architects"
  detail_level: "Implementation specifications"
```

### Story Quality Checklist
- [ ] **Independent**: Can be developed in any order
- [ ] **Negotiable**: Details can be discussed and refined
- [ ] **Valuable**: Provides clear business or user value
- [ ] **Estimable**: Development effort can be estimated
- [ ] **Small**: Can be completed within a sprint
- [ ] **Testable**: Success criteria can be verified

### Context-Specific Approaches

| Development Context | Story Focus | Key Considerations |
|-------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **API-First** | Data flow and system interactions | Backend services, data validation, integration points |
| **UI-First** | User interface and experience | Frontend components, user workflows, visual design |
| **Integration** | Cross-system functionality | Data mapping, system compatibility, error handling |

### Login/Registration Example Structure
