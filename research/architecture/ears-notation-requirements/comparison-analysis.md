Feature: User Authentication
  As a customer
  I want to log into my account
  So that I can access my personal information

  Scenario: Successful login
    Given I am on the login page
    And I have valid credentials
    When I enter my username and password
    And I click the login button
    Then I should be redirected to my dashboard
    And I should see a welcome message

  Scenario: Failed login
    Given I am on the login page
    When I enter invalid credentials
    And I click the login button
    Then I should see an error message
    And I should remain on the login page
```

#### EARS as BDD Foundation
```
# EARS Requirements (used to generate BDD scenarios)
WHEN a user submits valid login credentials, the system shall authenticate within 2 seconds.
IF a user submits invalid credentials, THEN the system shall display error message.

# Generated BDD Scenarios
Scenario: Successful login with performance requirement
  Given I have valid credentials
  When I submit the login form
  Then I should be authenticated within 2 seconds
  And redirected to dashboard

Scenario: Invalid credentials handling  
  Given I have invalid credentials
  When I submit the login form
  Then I should see "Invalid username or password"
  And remain on the login page
```

### EARS vs Use Cases (UML)

#### UML Use Case Format
**Example:**
```
Use Case: Process Customer Login
Actor: Customer
Goal: Authenticate customer and provide system access

Main Success Scenario:
1. Customer enters username and password
2. System validates credentials against database
3. System creates session and redirects to dashboard
4. Use case ends

Extensions:
2a. Invalid credentials:
    2a1. System displays error message
    2a2. Return to step 1
    
2b. Account locked:

## Hybrid Approaches

### EARS + BDD Integration

**Optimal Workflow:**
```markdown
1. Define EARS Requirements (Business Analysis Phase)
   - Event-driven: WHEN user submits form, system shall validate within 1 second
   - Unwanted Behavior: IF validation fails, THEN system shall highlight errors

2. Generate BDD Scenarios (Test Design Phase)
   Scenario: Form validation success
     Given valid form data
     When form is submitted  
     Then validation completes within 1 second
     
   Scenario: Form validation failure
     Given invalid form data
     When form is submitted
     Then errors are highlighted immediately

3. Implement Test Automation (Development Phase)
   - BDD scenarios drive automated test creation
   - EARS requirements ensure complete coverage
```
