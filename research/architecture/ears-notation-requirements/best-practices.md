# Best Practices for EARS Notation

## Writing Effective EARS Requirements

### Core Writing Principles

#### 1. Atomic Requirements
Each EARS requirement should express exactly one testable behavior or constraint.

**✅ Good Example:**
```
WHEN a user clicks the "Submit Order" button, the system shall validate the shopping cart contents.
IF the shopping cart is empty, THEN the system shall display an error message "Cart cannot be empty".
WHEN cart validation passes, the system shall proceed to the payment screen.
```

**❌ Poor Example:**
```
WHEN a user clicks submit, the system shall validate the cart and show errors if needed and go to payment if valid.
```

#### 2. Measurable and Specific
Include quantifiable criteria whenever possible to enable objective testing.

**✅ Good Examples:**
```
The system shall process login requests within 2 seconds under normal load conditions.
WHEN disk usage exceeds 85%, the system shall send an alert to administrators within 1 minute.
IF a user enters an invalid password, THEN the system shall lock the account after 3 consecutive failures.
```

**❌ Poor Examples:**
```
The system shall respond quickly to user requests.
The system shall handle errors appropriately.
The system shall provide good performance.
```

#### 3. Consistent Terminology
Use standardized terms throughout all requirements to avoid confusion.

**Recommended Term Dictionary:**
```yaml
System Components:
  - "authentication module" (not "login system" or "auth component")
  - "user interface" (not "frontend" or "UI")
  - "database" (not "data store" or "persistence layer")
  
Actions:
  - "authenticate" (not "log in" or "sign in")
  - "authorize" (not "permit" or "allow")
  - "validate" (not "check" or "verify")
  
States:
  - "active session" (not "logged in state")
  - "maintenance mode" (not "down for maintenance")
  - "processing" (not "working" or "busy")
```

### Template-Specific Best Practices

#### Ubiquitous Requirements

**Best For:**
- System-wide constraints
- Non-functional requirements
- Regulatory compliance requirements
- Basic system capabilities

**Writing Guidelines:**
```
Pattern: The system shall [specific action/constraint] [measurable criteria]

✅ Examples:
- The system shall encrypt all data at rest using AES-256 encryption.
- The system shall maintain audit logs for all user actions for a minimum of 7 years.
- The system shall support concurrent access by up to 1,000 users.

❌ Avoid:
- The system shall be secure. (too vague)
- The system shall handle user data properly. (undefined action)
```

#### Event-Driven Requirements

**Best For:**
- User interactions
- System-to-system communications
- Time-based triggers
- External event responses

**Writing Guidelines:**
```
Pattern: WHEN [specific trigger] the system shall [specific response] [within timeframe]

✅ Examples:
- WHEN a user submits a password reset request, the system shall send a reset email within 5 minutes.
- WHEN the backup process completes, the system shall update the backup status dashboard.
- WHEN a new user registers, the system shall create a welcome email queue entry.

❌ Avoid:
- WHEN something happens, the system shall do something. (too vague)
- WHEN a user does stuff, the system shall respond. (undefined triggers and responses)
```

#### Unwanted Behavior Requirements

**Best For:**
- Error handling
- Security violations
- Resource constraints
- Edge case management

**Writing Guidelines:**
```
Pattern: IF [specific error condition] THEN the system shall [specific recovery action] [and notification]

✅ Examples:
- IF a database connection fails, THEN the system shall retry every 30 seconds for up to 5 attempts.
- IF a user uploads a file larger than 10MB, THEN the system shall reject the upload and display a size limit error.
- IF payment processing fails, THEN the system shall log the error and notify the user with retry options.

❌ Avoid:
- IF there are problems, THEN the system shall fix them. (undefined problems and solutions)
- IF something goes wrong, THEN show an error. (too generic)
```

#### State-Driven Requirements

**Best For:**
- Continuous monitoring
- Background processes
- State-dependent behaviors
- Resource management

**Writing Guidelines:**
```
Pattern: WHILE [specific state/condition] the system shall [continuous action] [with frequency/criteria]

✅ Examples:
- WHILE a user session is active, the system shall refresh the authentication token every 15 minutes.
- WHILE the system is in maintenance mode, the system shall display a maintenance notice to all visitors.
- WHILE a backup is in progress, the system shall block write operations to ensure data consistency.

❌ Avoid:
- WHILE running, the system shall work properly. (undefined state and action)
- WHILE things are happening, the system shall monitor. (vague conditions)
```

#### Optional Requirements

**Best For:**
- Feature toggles
- Configuration-dependent functionality
- Platform-specific capabilities
- Subscription-based features

**Writing Guidelines:**
```
Pattern: WHERE [specific feature/configuration] is available, the system shall [specific behavior]

✅ Examples:
- WHERE two-factor authentication is enabled, the system shall require SMS verification for all logins.
- WHERE the premium subscription is active, the system shall provide access to advanced reporting features.
- WHERE GPS capabilities are available, the system shall record location data for delivery tracking.

❌ Avoid:
- WHERE possible, the system shall provide features. (undefined availability and features)
- WHERE appropriate, the system shall do things. (vague conditions)
```

#### Complex Requirements

**Best For:**
- Multi-condition logic
- Security-sensitive operations
- Business rule combinations
- Cascading behaviors

**Writing Guidelines:**
```
Pattern: IF [condition] THEN WHEN [trigger] the system shall [response] [additional actions]

✅ Examples:
- IF the user has administrative privileges, THEN WHEN the user selects "Delete All Records", the system shall require two-factor authentication before proceeding.
- IF the account balance is below $100, THEN WHEN a user attempts a wire transfer, the system shall decline the transaction and suggest alternative payment methods.

❌ Avoid:
- IF stuff happens THEN WHEN things occur the system shall do something. (multiple vague elements)
```

```

### Common Anti-Patterns and Solutions

#### Anti-Pattern 1: Multiple Requirements in One Statement

**❌ Problem:**
```
WHEN a user logs in, the system shall authenticate the user and update the last login time and send a welcome email and redirect to dashboard.
```

**✅ Solution:**
```
WHEN a user submits valid login credentials, the system shall authenticate the user within 2 seconds.
WHEN user authentication succeeds, the system shall update the last login timestamp.
WHEN user authentication succeeds, the system shall queue a welcome email for delivery.
WHEN user authentication succeeds, the system shall redirect to the user dashboard.
```

#### Anti-Pattern 2: Vague Conditions and Triggers

**❌ Problem:**
```
WHEN something goes wrong, the system shall handle it appropriately.
IF there are issues, THEN the system shall fix them.
```

**✅ Solution:**
```
WHEN the database response time exceeds 10 seconds, the system shall display a timeout message to the user.
IF the primary database server becomes unavailable, THEN the system shall failover to the backup server within 30 seconds.
```

#### Anti-Pattern 3: Unmeasurable Performance Requirements

**❌ Problem:**
```
The system shall be fast and reliable.
The system shall provide good user experience.
```

**✅ Solution:**
```
The system shall respond to user interactions within 200 milliseconds under normal load conditions.
The system shall maintain 99.9% uptime during business hours (8 AM - 6 PM EST).
WHEN a user navigates between pages, the system shall complete the transition within 1 second.
```

#### Anti-Pattern 4: Implementation-Specific Requirements

**❌ Problem:**
```
The system shall use MySQL database to store user data.
The system shall implement OAuth2 for authentication.
```

**✅ Solution:**
```
The system shall persist user data with ACID transaction guarantees.
WHEN a user authenticates, the system shall verify credentials against a secure authentication service.
The system shall support single sign-on integration with corporate identity providers.
```

## Integration Best Practices

### EARS with Agile User Stories

#### Enhanced User Story Template

```markdown
# User Story with EARS Integration

## User Story

**I want** [functionality]
**So that** [business value]

**Story Points:** [estimation]
**Priority:** [high/medium/low]

## EARS Requirements

### Primary Flow
1. **Event-driven:** WHEN [user action], the system shall [system response] [within timeframe]
2. **Ubiquitous:** The system shall [system constraint/capability]

### Alternative Flows
1. **Optional:** WHERE [condition], the system shall [alternative behavior]

### Error Handling
1. **Unwanted Behavior:** IF [error condition], THEN the system shall [error response]

### Continuous Behaviors
1. **State-driven:** WHILE [state], the system shall [ongoing behavior]

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All EARS requirements implemented and tested
- [ ] Acceptance criteria verified through automated tests
- [ ] Performance criteria validated
- [ ] Error handling tested and working
- [ ] User experience validated with stakeholders

## Test Scenarios
Derived directly from EARS requirements:

1. **Happy Path Test:**
   - Given: [precondition from EARS]
   - When: [action from EARS trigger]
   - Then: [expected outcome from EARS response]

2. **Error Path Test:**
   - Given: [error condition from EARS]
   - When: [error trigger]
   - Then: [error response from EARS]
```

#### Example: Complete User Story with EARS

```markdown
# Login Functionality

## User Story
**As a** registered user
**I want** to log into the application securely
**So that** I can access my personal dashboard and data

**Story Points:** 5
**Priority:** High

## EARS Requirements

### Primary Flow
1. **Event-driven:** WHEN a user submits valid login credentials, the system shall authenticate the user within 2 seconds.
2. **Event-driven:** WHEN authentication succeeds, the system shall redirect the user to their personal dashboard.
3. **Ubiquitous:** The system shall encrypt all authentication communications using TLS 1.3.

### Security Requirements
1. **Unwanted Behavior:** IF a user submits invalid credentials, THEN the system shall display a generic error message and log the failed attempt.
2. **Unwanted Behavior:** IF a user fails authentication 3 consecutive times, THEN the system shall temporarily lock the account for 15 minutes.
3. **State-driven:** WHILE a user session is active, the system shall validate the session token every 10 minutes.

### Optional Features
1. **Optional:** WHERE two-factor authentication is enabled, the system shall require SMS verification after password validation.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] User can log in with valid credentials within 2 seconds
- [ ] Invalid credentials show appropriate error message
- [ ] Account lockout works after 3 failed attempts
- [ ] Session validation occurs every 10 minutes
- [ ] 2FA integration works when enabled
- [ ] All communications encrypted with TLS 1.3

## Test Scenarios

### Happy Path
- **Given:** User has valid credentials and account is not locked
- **When:** User submits login form with correct username and password
- **Then:** System authenticates within 2 seconds and redirects to dashboard

### Error Handling
- **Given:** User submits invalid credentials
- **When:** Login form is submitted
- **Then:** System shows generic error and logs attempt

### Security Features
- **Given:** User has failed login 2 times already
- **When:** User fails login third time
- **Then:** System locks account for 15 minutes and notifies user
```

### EARS with Acceptance Criteria

#### BDD Integration Pattern

```gherkin
# Acceptance criteria derived from EARS requirements

Feature: User Authentication
  As a registered user
  I want to log into the application securely
  So that I can access my personal data

  # From EARS: "WHEN a user submits valid login credentials, 
  # the system shall authenticate the user within 2 seconds"
  Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
    Given a user with valid credentials exists in the system
    When the user submits the login form with correct username and password
    Then the system should authenticate the user within 2 seconds
    And the user should be redirected to their dashboard

  # From EARS: "IF a user submits invalid credentials, 
  # THEN the system shall display a generic error message"
  Scenario: Failed login with invalid credentials
    Given a user attempts to log in
    When the user submits incorrect credentials
    Then the system should display "Invalid username or password"
    And the failed attempt should be logged for security monitoring

  # From EARS: "IF a user fails authentication 3 consecutive times, 
  # THEN the system shall temporarily lock the account for 15 minutes"
  Scenario: Account lockout after repeated failures
    Given a user has failed authentication 2 times
    When the user fails authentication a third time
    Then the account should be locked for 15 minutes
    And the user should see "Account temporarily locked" message
    And the lockout should be logged for security review
```
