## Quick Reference

### The 6 EARS Requirement Templates

| Template | Pattern | Use Case |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **Ubiquitous** | The system shall [requirement] | Basic functional requirements |
| **Event-driven** | WHEN [trigger] the system shall [response] | System responses to events |
| **Unwanted Behavior** | IF [condition] THEN the system shall [response] | Error handling and edge cases |
| **State-driven** | WHILE [state] the system shall [requirement] | Continuous system behaviors |
| **Optional** | WHERE [feature] is available, the system shall [requirement] | Conditional functionality |
| **Complex** | IF [condition] THEN WHEN [trigger] the system shall [response] | Multi-condition requirements |

### EARS Requirements Structure
```
[EARS Template] + [Clear Action] + [Measurable Outcome] + [Acceptance Criteria]

Example:
WHEN a user submits a login form with valid credentials
THE system shall authenticate the user within 2 seconds
AND redirect to the user dashboard
```

### Integration with User Stories
```
User Story: As a [role], I want [functionality] so that [benefit]
EARS Requirements:
- WHEN [user action] the system shall [system response]
- IF [error condition] THEN the system shall [error handling]
- The system shall [non-functional requirement]
```

### Technology Stack for EARS Implementation
| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| Documentation | Markdown + YAML | Structured requirements files |
| Validation | Custom Scripts | EARS syntax compliance checking |
| Integration | JIRA/Azure DevOps | Requirement tracking and management |
| Templates | JSON Schema | Standardized requirement formats |
| Quality Assurance | Automated Testing | Requirements traceability verification |
