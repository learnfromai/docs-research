# AWS Lambda & Serverless Architecture
## Function-as-a-Service Implementation and Patterns

### üìã Overview

This comprehensive research explores AWS Lambda and serverless architecture patterns, specifically focusing on Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) implementations for EdTech platforms. The research addresses practical implementation strategies for Philippines-based developers building scalable educational platforms similar to Khan Academy, with considerations for remote work in AU, UK, and US markets.

### üöÄ Quick Reference

#### **Technology Stack Recommendations**

| Component | Primary Choice | Alternative | Use Case |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|----------|
| **Compute** | AWS Lambda | Fargate | Event-driven functions vs. containerized apps |
| **API Gateway** | API Gateway v2 | ALB + Lambda | REST/GraphQL APIs vs HTTP APIs |
| **Database** | DynamoDB | RDS Aurora Serverless | NoSQL document store vs relational data |
| **Storage** | S3 | EFS | Static assets vs shared file systems |
| **Authentication** | Cognito | Auth0 | Native AWS vs third-party identity |
| **Monitoring** | CloudWatch | Datadog | Native monitoring vs comprehensive observability |
| **IaC** | AWS CDK | Terraform | Type-safe infrastructure vs multi-cloud |

#### **EdTech-Specific Considerations**

- **FERPA Compliance**: Data privacy requirements for educational records
- **Global Latency**: CloudFront integration for international users
- **Cost Predictability**: Reserved capacity and savings plans for stable workloads
- **Auto-scaling**: Exam period traffic spikes and load management
- **Content Delivery**: Video streaming and interactive content optimization

#### **Regional Market Considerations**

- **Philippines**: Local data residency, payment gateway integrations
- **Australia**: Privacy Act compliance, data sovereignty requirements
- **United Kingdom**: GDPR compliance, educational data protection
- **United States**: COPPA/FERPA compliance, state-specific regulations
