# Railway.com Platform Research - Building a Modern PaaS Platform

## üöÄ Overview

This research explores how to create a platform like Railway.com, a modern Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that simplifies application deployment and infrastructure management. Railway competes with platforms like Heroku, Vercel, and AWS App Runner by providing seamless deployment workflows, automatic scaling, and developer-friendly tooling.

**Research Validation**: Building a Railway.com-like platform requires comprehensive expertise across **Full Stack Web Development**, **DevOps/Cloud Infrastructure**, **Network Engineering**, and **Security** - confirming the need for interdisciplinary learning.
