# Alerting Strategies

> Comprehensive guide to designing, implementing, and managing effective alerting strategies for EdTech platforms using modern monitoring tools.

## 🎯 Alerting Philosophy

### The Alert Pyramid

```
                    🚨 Critical (Page Immediately)
                         Service Down, Data Loss
                    ──────────────────────────────
                  ⚠️  Warning (Notify During Hours)
                Performance Degradation, Capacity Issues
                ────────────────────────────────────────
              📊 Information (Email/Dashboard)
            Deployments, Maintenance, Trend Analysis  
            ──────────────────────────────────────────
          📈 Metrics Collection (No Direct Alerts)
        Request Rates, User Behavior, Feature Usage
```

### Alert Design Principles

**1. Alert on Symptoms, Not Causes**
```yaml
# ✅ Good: Alert on user impact
- alert: HighResponseTime
  expr: http_request_duration_p95 > 3
  annotations:
    summary: "Users experiencing slow response times"

# ❌ Bad: Alert on infrastructure metrics without context
- alert: HighCPU
  expr: cpu_usage > 70
  # What if high CPU is normal during course enrollment periods?
```

**2. Make Alerts Actionable**
```yaml
- alert: DatabaseConnectionsHigh
  expr: db_connections_active / db_connections_max > 0.8
  annotations:
    summary: "Database connection pool nearly exhausted"
    description: "{{ $value | humanizePercentage }} of connections in use"
    runbook_url: "https://docs.company.com/runbooks/database-connections"
    action_required: "Check for connection leaks, consider scaling database"
```

**3. Provide Context and Remediation**
```yaml
annotations:
  summary: "EdTech platform error rate elevated"
  description: |
    Error rate is {{ $value | humanizePercentage }} for the last 5 minutes.
    This may impact user course access and payment processing.
    
    Recent changes:
    - Deployment: {{ $labels.version }}
    - Traffic pattern: {{ $labels.traffic_source }}
    
    Immediate actions:
    1. Check application logs for errors
    2. Verify database connectivity
    3. Consider rollback if deployment-related

          severity: critical
          team: backend
          service: application
          impact: "complete_outage"
        annotations:
          summary: "EdTech application is completely down"
          description: "Application {{ $labels.instance }} has been unreachable for 1+ minutes"
          impact: "All users unable to access courses, payments, and content"

## 📈 Alert Metrics and SLOs

### Monitoring Your Monitoring

```yaml
# Alert effectiveness metrics
groups:
  - name: alerting.meta.rules
    rules:
      # Alert volume by severity
      - record: alerting:alerts_firing:total
        expr: sum(ALERTS{alertstate="firing"}) by (severity)
        
      # Mean time to resolution
      - record: alerting:mttr:minutes
        expr: avg(alert_resolution_time_seconds) / 60
        
      # False positive rate
      - record: alerting:false_positive_rate:percentage
        expr: |
          (
            sum(increase(alerts_resolved_without_action_total[24h])) /
            sum(increase(alerts_fired_total[24h]))
          ) * 100
          
      # Alert fatigue indicator
      - record: alerting:notification_rate:per_hour
        expr: rate(alertmanager_notifications_total[1h])
```

### Alert Quality SLOs

```yaml
# Service Level Objectives for alerting system
alerting_slos:
  # Alert reliability
  - name: "Alert delivery reliability"
    target: "99.9%"
    measurement: "successful_notifications / total_notifications"
    
  # Response time
  - name: "Time to first notification"
    target: "< 2 minutes"
    measurement: "notification_time - alert_fire_time"
    
  # False positive rate
  - name: "Alert accuracy"
    target: "< 5% false positives"
    measurement: "alerts_resolved_without_action / total_alerts"
    
  # Mean time to resolution
  - name: "Incident resolution speed"
    target: "< 30 minutes for critical alerts"
    measurement: "alert_resolve_time - alert_fire_time"
```

## 🧠 Alert Intelligence and Automation

### Smart Alert Grouping

```yaml
# Group related alerts to reduce noise
route:
  group_by: ['alertname', 'service', 'cluster']
  group_wait: 30s        # Wait for related alerts
  group_interval: 5m     # Batch interval for same group
  repeat_interval: 12h   # Re-send grouped alerts

# Inhibition rules - suppress lower severity when higher exists
inhibit_rules:
  - source_match:
      severity: 'critical'
    target_match:
      severity: 'warning'
    equal: ['service', 'instance']
    
  - source_match:
      alertname: 'ApplicationDown'
    target_match_re:
      alertname: '(HighResponseTime|ElevatedErrorRate)'
    equal: ['service']
```

### Context-Aware Alerting

```yaml
# Business context in alerts
- alert: HighTrafficDuringExamPeriod
  expr: |
    (
      rate(http_requests_total[5m]) > 1000
      and on() 
      exam_period_active == 1
    )
  for: 5m
  labels:
    severity: info
    context: exam_period
  annotations:
    summary: "High traffic during licensure exam period"
    description: "Expected high load due to exam registration/practice"
    action: "Monitor for performance issues, scale if needed"

# Seasonal adjustments
- alert: LowTrafficOffSeason
  expr: |
    (
      rate(http_requests_total[1h]) < 100
      and on()
      month() in (12, 1, 2)  # Holiday season
    )
  for: 6h
  labels:
    severity: info
    context: seasonal
  annotations:
    summary: "Expected low traffic during holiday season"
```

## 🔧 Alert Testing and Validation

### Synthetic Alerting Tests

```yaml
# Test alert pipeline
- alert: AlertingTestFiring
  expr: vector(1)  # Always true
  for: 0s
  labels:
    severity: test
    team: platform
  annotations:
    summary: "Alerting pipeline test"
    description: "This alert tests notification delivery"
    
# Schedule via cron job
# 0 9 * * 1 curl -X POST http://prometheus:9090/api/v1/admin/tsdb/delete_series?match[]={__name__="alerting_test"}
```

### Alert Validation Process

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Alert validation script

PROMETHEUS_URL="http://localhost:9090"
ALERT_RULES_DIR="./prometheus/rules"

echo "🔍 Validating alert rules..."

# Check syntax
for file in ${ALERT_RULES_DIR}/*.yml; do
    echo "Checking ${file}..."
    promtool check rules ${file} || exit 1
done

# Test queries against historical data
echo "📊 Testing alert queries..."
promtool query instant ${PROMETHEUS_URL} 'up{job="application"} == 0'

# Validate runbook URLs
echo "📚 Checking runbook links..."
grep -r "runbook_url" ${ALERT_RULES_DIR} | while read line; do
    url=$(echo $line | grep -o 'https://[^"]*')
    curl -I --silent --fail $url || echo "❌ Broken runbook: $url"
done

echo "✅ Alert validation complete"
```

## 📚 Alert Documentation Standards

### Runbook Template

```markdown
# Alert: High Error Rate

## Severity: Critical

### Description
Application is experiencing elevated error rates that may impact user experience.

### Impact
- Users unable to access courses
- Payment processing may fail  
- Potential revenue loss

### Immediate Actions
1. Check application logs for error patterns
2. Verify database connectivity
3. Check recent deployments
4. Monitor user-facing services

### Investigation Steps
1. **Check Error Breakdown**
   ```promql
   sum(rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m])) by (status, handler)
   ```

2. **Identify Error Sources**
   ```bash
   kubectl logs -f deployment/edtech-app | grep ERROR
   ```

3. **Database Health Check**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active';
   ```

### Escalation
- If error rate >10%: Page on-call engineer
- If database issues: Contact @database-team
- If payment related: Contact @payments-team

### Resolution Criteria
- Error rate <1% for 10+ minutes
- All dependent services healthy
- User experience validated

### Post-Incident
- Update post-mortem template
- Review alert thresholds
- Document lessons learned
```
