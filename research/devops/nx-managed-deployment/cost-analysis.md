## 🎯 Cost Optimization Strategies

### Strategy 1: Monorepo Deployment
```
Instead of:
├── Frontend App: $12/month
├── Backend App: $12/month  
└── Database: $15/month
Total: $39/month

Use Railway monorepo:
├── Frontend + Backend: $5/month
├── Database: Included
└── Total: $5/month

Savings: $34/month (85% reduction)
```

### Strategy 2: Free Tier Maximization
```
Render Free Tier Optimization:
├── Frontend: Free (static hosting)
├── Backend: Free* (with sleep)
├── Database: Railway $5/month
└── Total: $5/month

*Acceptable for low-traffic applications
```

### Strategy 3: Hybrid Platform Approach
```
Performance + Cost Balance:
├── Frontend: Vercel Free
├── Backend: Railway $5/month
├── Database: PlanetScale Free
└── Total: $0-5/month

Good for: MVP, low-traffic apps
```
