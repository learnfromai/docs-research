### Research Request

What is the best practice to deploy Nx project? For example, I have a full stack Nx project, where I have 2 deployable apps, one is React frontend (vite) and other is express backend. I want the managed services because I will handover the app to a client and they won't be knowledgeable in devops. I plan to utilize Digital Ocean managed apps.

Also, Which free platform can I use to simulate this setup? The setup where you have monorepo with nx then deploy the frontend and backend separately.

### Research Guidelines & Requirements

Research Focus: Best practices for deploying full-stack Nx projects (React + Express) to managed app providers, specifically targeting Digital Ocean and free simulation platforms for client handovers.
