Research Request: Deploy Nx to managed app providers

What is the best practice to deploy Nx project? For example, I have a full stack Nx project, where I have 2 deployable apps, one is React frontend (vite) and other is express backend. I want the managed services because I will handover the app to a client and they won't be knowledgeable in devops. 

Research for manage app deployment providers which includes digital ocean managed apps, render, railway, etc.

Also consider the database part where to deploy it. We need to deploy the MySQL. 

If possible, goal is the cheapest option.
