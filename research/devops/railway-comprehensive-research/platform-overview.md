# Platform Overview: How Railway.com Works

## üöÇ What is Railway.com?

Railway is a cloud application platform that simplifies software deployment and infrastructure management. Think of it as a modern Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that combines the simplicity of Heroku with the power and flexibility of modern cloud infrastructure.

## üèóÔ∏è Core Architecture

### Service-Based Deployment Model
Railway organizes applications into **services** within **projects**:

```
Project: Clinic Management System
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Frontend Service (React/Vite)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Backend Service (Express.js API)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Database Service (MySQL)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Cache Service (Redis) [optional]
```

### Infrastructure Abstraction
- **No Docker knowledge required**: Railway handles containerization automatically
- **Git-based deployments**: Push to GitHub triggers automatic builds and deployments
- **Zero-config scaling**: Services automatically scale based on traffic and resource needs
- **Managed networking**: Services communicate through internal networking without manual configuration

## üîß Key Features

### 1. Git Integration
```bash
# Connect repository
railway link

# Deploy on every push
git push origin main  # Automatic deployment triggered
```

### 2. Environment Management
- **Multiple environments**: Production, staging, development per project
- **Environment variables**: Secure configuration management
- **Service discovery**: Automatic service-to-service communication
- **Database connections**: Automatic connection string generation

### 3. Database Services
Railway provides managed databases with:
- **PostgreSQL**: Full-featured relational database
- **MySQL**: Traditional RDBMS with broad compatibility
- **Redis**: In-memory caching and session storage
- **MongoDB**: Document-based NoSQL database

### 4. Observability
- **Real-time logs**: Aggregated logging across all services
- **Metrics dashboard**: CPU, memory, and request metrics
- **Deployment history**: Track all deployments and rollbacks
- **Health monitoring**: Automatic health checks and alerts

## üåê Global Infrastructure

### Edge Network
- **Multiple regions**: US, Europe, Asia-Pacific
- **CDN integration**: Automatic static asset caching
- **Low-latency routing**: Requests routed to nearest region
- **Load balancing**: Automatic traffic distribution

### Security Features
- **TLS/SSL certificates**: Automatic HTTPS for all domains
- **Private networking**: Secure service-to-service communication
- **Environment isolation**: Complete separation between environments
- **SOC 2 compliance**: Enterprise-grade security standards

    F --> G[Monitor & Scale]
```

### Build Process
1. **Source Detection**: Railway analyzes your codebase
2. **Dependency Installation**: Automatic package manager detection (npm, pip, etc.)
3. **Build Execution**: Runs build commands specific to your framework
4. **Image Creation**: Packages application into container image
5. **Deployment**: Rolls out new version with zero-downtime deployment

## üîå Railway CLI

### Installation
```bash
# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install railway

# Windows (Scoop)
scoop install railway

# Linux/macOS (curl)
curl -fsSL https://railway.app/install.sh | sh
```

### Essential Commands
```bash
# Authentication
railway login

# Project management
railway init                 # Create new project
railway link                 # Link existing project
railway status              # View project status

# Service management
railway up                   # Deploy current directory
railway deploy              # Deploy specific service
railway logs                # View service logs
railway shell               # Connect to service shell

# Environment management
railway environment         # Switch environments
railway variables           # Manage environment variables
```

## üîç Service Configuration

### railway.json Example
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS",
    "buildCommand": "npm run build"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "npm start",
    "healthcheckPath": "/health",
    "healthcheckTimeout": 300,
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables
Railway automatically injects service-specific environment variables:
```bash
# Database connection
DATABASE_URL=mysql://user:password@host:port/database

# Service URLs  
BACKEND_URL=https://backend-production.up.railway.app
FRONTEND_URL=https://frontend-production.up.railway.app

# Railway-specific
RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT=production
RAILWAY_SERVICE_NAME=backend
RAILWAY_PROJECT_NAME=clinic-management
```

## üéØ Nx Monorepo Integration

### Project Structure Recognition
Railway automatically detects Nx workspaces and can deploy multiple applications:

```
apps/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ web/                 # React frontend
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api/                 # Express.js backend
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ mobile/              # React Native (if applicable)

libs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/              # Shared TypeScript libraries
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/                  # UI component library
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ data-access/         # API client libraries
```

### Service Configuration for Nx
```yaml
# railway.yaml for frontend service
services:
  web:
    source: apps/web
    build:
      command: npx nx build web
    variables:
      NODE_ENV: production

  api:
    source: apps/api  
    build:
      command: npx nx build api
    variables:
      NODE_ENV: production
```

## üìä Performance Characteristics

### Cold Start Times
- **Node.js applications**: 1-3 seconds
- **Static sites**: Instant (cached)
- **Database services**: Always warm (managed)

### Scaling Behavior
- **Horizontal scaling**: Multiple instances automatically created
- **Vertical scaling**: Memory and CPU allocated based on demand
- **Auto-sleep**: Hobby plan services sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity
- **Instant wake**: Services wake on first request in <1 second

## üîê Security Model

### Network Security
- **Private networking**: Services communicate over private network
- **TLS termination**: All external traffic encrypted
- **IP allowlisting**: Restrict access to specific IP ranges
- **VPN support**: Site-to-site VPN for enterprise customers

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at rest**: All data encrypted in storage
- **Backup automation**: Daily backups for database services
- **Point-in-time recovery**: Restore database to any point in last 7 days
