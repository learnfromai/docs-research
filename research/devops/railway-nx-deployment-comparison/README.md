## üéØ Research Scope

This research compares **two deployment strategies** for Nx monorepo applications on Railway.com:

### **Strategy A: Separate Deployment**
- **Frontend**: React Vite app deployed as static service
- **Backend**: Express.js API deployed as web service  
- **Architecture**: Microservices approach with independent scaling

### **Strategy B: Combined Deployment**
- **Frontend + Backend**: Single Express.js service serving React static files
- **Architecture**: Monolithic approach with unified deployment

## üè• Project Context

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Application Type** | Clinic Management System |
| **User Base** | 2-3 clinic staff members |
| **Primary Goal** | Optimal performance for small teams |
| **Technology Stack** | Nx + React + Vite + Express.js + TypeScript |
| **PWA Target** | Offline capability for poor internet conditions |
| **Deployment Platform** | Railway.com managed hosting |

## üìä Evaluation Criteria

Each deployment strategy is evaluated across **10 key criteria** using a 1-10 scoring scale:

| Criteria | Weight | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Performance & Speed** | High | Response times, loading performance, resource optimization |
| **Deployment Complexity** | Medium | Setup difficulty, configuration complexity, deployment process |
| **Cost Efficiency** | High | Railway.com service costs, resource utilization, scaling costs |
| **Scalability** | Medium | Ability to handle growth, resource scaling options |
| **Maintenance Overhead** | High | Ongoing maintenance, updates, monitoring requirements |
| **PWA Compatibility** | High | Service worker support, caching strategies, offline capabilities |
| **Security** | High | Attack surface, authentication, data protection |
| **Development Experience** | Medium | Developer productivity, debugging, local development |
| **Monitoring & Debugging** | Medium | Observability, logging, error tracking capabilities |
| **Backup & Recovery** | Medium | Data protection, disaster recovery, rollback capabilities |
