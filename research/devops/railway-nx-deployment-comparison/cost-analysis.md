    codesplitting: 'Load only necessary components'
  },
  
  caching: {
    staticAssets: 'CDN caching reduces origin requests',
    apiCaching: 'Reduce backend load by 40-60%',
    browserCaching: 'Minimize repeat downloads'
  },
  
  bandwidth: {
    currentUsage: '8-12GB/month',
    optimizedUsage: '5-8GB/month',
    savings: '$0-2/month (within free tier)'
  }
};
```

#### Backend Resource Management
```typescript
// API service optimization

Scalability             15%       9/10         6/10         A
Maintenance             10%       6/10         9/10         B

Weighted Score:                   7.1/10       8.0/10       Strategy B
```

**Recommendation**: For clinic management systems with 2-3 users, **Strategy B (Combined Deployment)** provides the best cost-performance balance with **$60/year in savings** and significantly lower operational complexity.

**Migration Path**: Start with Strategy B for immediate cost benefits. Monitor usage and consider Strategy A only when user base exceeds 10 concurrent users or performance requirements justify the additional 25-30% cost premium.
