# Open Source DevOps Projects: Terraform + AWS/Kubernetes/EKS

## üéØ Overview

This research provides a comprehensive analysis of production-ready open source DevOps projects that demonstrate best practices for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform with AWS services, particularly focusing on Kubernetes and EKS implementations. The goal is to provide learning references for studying how these technologies are properly integrated in real-world scenarios.
