## üîé Research Scope & Methodology

This research focused on identifying and analyzing open source projects that demonstrate:
- **Terraform Infrastructure as Code** for AWS resources
- **Kubernetes cluster management** and orchestration
- **Amazon EKS** integration and best practices
- **Production-ready configurations** with proper security and monitoring
- **Real-world use cases** rather than simple tutorials

**Research Methodology:**
- GitHub repository analysis with focus on stars, activity, and maintenance
- Documentation quality and completeness assessment
- Code review for best practices and production readiness
- Integration patterns and architectural approach evaluation
