[Research] Perform research for open source devops projects that uses terraform with AWS and/or with kubernetes and/or EKS

Goal is to have reference to study production-ready devops projects. Look as many as you can. I want to learn how terraform with AWS and/or with kubernetes and/or EKS is properly used.

### Research Guidelines & Requirements

This research should focus on finding real-world, production-ready open source projects that demonstrate best practices for:

1. **Terraform + AWS**: Infrastructure provisioning and management
2. **Terraform + Kubernetes**: Kubernetes cluster management and application deployment  
3. **Terraform + EKS**: Amazon EKS cluster setup and workload management
4. **Combined approaches**: Projects that integrate all three technologies

The goal is to provide comprehensive references for learning proper infrastructure-as-code practices in production environments.
