1. **Cost Efficiency** (9.0/10) - 38% lower total cost of ownership
2. **Development Experience** (8.8/10) - Faster development cycles
3. **Maintenance Overhead** (9.0/10) - Simplified operations
4. **Performance** (8.5/10) - Better user experience

### Alternative Scenarios Where Separate Deployments Excel
1. **High-Traffic Applications** (>100 concurrent users)
2. **Multi-Tenant SaaS Platforms**
3. **Teams with Microservices Expertise**
4. **Applications Requiring Independent Service Scaling**
