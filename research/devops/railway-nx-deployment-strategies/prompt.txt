Research Request: Railway.com deployment strategies for Nx React/Express app

For context, the React app is using Vite. There are two options.

First, deploy React separately as static deployment in Railway (I think this is possible but I haven't tried it) and Express as a web service (not sure what is the correct terminology, but the idea is the express is runnin on node server). 

Second, deploywith just one deployment, the express main server, and just serve the react through express static serving with something like this: app.use(express.static(reactClientPath)); Not sure what is the correct way, but you get the idea.

For context, the project is a Clinic Management System, primarily used by the staffs of small clinic (2-3 users). Goal is of course, performance. And I'm thinking it to make the react app a PWA. This might help improve the performance, like what if internet becomes slow. At least with PWA, the static assets are loaded locally. 

Create comprehensive criteria, rate each from 1-10 and compute the average score.
