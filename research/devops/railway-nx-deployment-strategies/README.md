## ðŸŽ¯ Research Scope & Methodology

### Project Context
- **Application**: Clinic Management System
- **Architecture**: Nx monorepo with React (Vite) frontend and Express.js backend
- **Target Users**: 2-3 staff members in small clinics
- **Primary Goal**: Performance optimization
- **Secondary Goal**: PWA implementation for offline capabilities

### Deployment Options Analyzed

#### Option 1: Separate Deployments
- **Frontend**: React (Vite) as static site deployment
- **Backend**: Express.js as web service
- **Communication**: API calls between separate services

#### Option 2: Single Deployment
- **Architecture**: Express.js server serving React build files
- **Implementation**: `app.use(express.static(reactClientPath))`
- **Communication**: Server-side rendering or SPA routing

### Evaluation Criteria
Each deployment strategy is evaluated across 10 key criteria using a 1-10 scale:

1. **Performance** - Load times, response speeds, caching efficiency
2. **Cost Efficiency** - Resource usage and pricing implications
3. **Scalability** - Ability to handle growth and traffic spikes
4. **Development Experience** - Ease of development and debugging
5. **Deployment Complexity** - Setup and maintenance overhead
6. **PWA Implementation** - Service worker and offline capabilities
7. **Security** - Attack surface and security best practices
8. **Monitoring & Debugging** - Observability and troubleshooting
9. **Backup & Recovery** - Data protection and disaster recovery
10. **Maintenance Overhead** - Long-term operational requirements
