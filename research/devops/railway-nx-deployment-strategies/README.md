## üéØ Research Scope

This research compares **two Railway.com deployment strategies** for Nx React/Express applications:

### Strategy 1: Separate Deployments
- **React Frontend**: Deployed as static site on Railway
- **Express Backend**: Deployed as web service on Railway
- **Database**: Railway PostgreSQL/MySQL service
- **Communication**: API calls between services

### Strategy 2: Single Deployment  
- **Unified Service**: Express server serving React static files
- **Static Serving**: `app.use(express.static(reactClientPath))`
- **Database**: Railway database service
- **Routing**: Express handles both API and frontend routes

## üè• Project Context

**Application Type**: Clinic Management System PWA
- **Users**: 2-3 clinic staff members
- **Performance Priority**: High (PWA offline capabilities)
- **Internet Reliability**: Variable (clinic environments)
- **Technical Expertise**: Limited (non-technical staff)

## üõ† Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Railway Deployment |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| **Frontend** | React + Vite + TypeScript | Static site or Express static |
| **Backend** | Express.js + Node.js | Web service |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL/MySQL | Railway database service |
| **Monorepo** | Nx workspace | Multi-service or single service |
| **PWA** | Service Worker + Manifest | Optimized static serving |

## üìä Evaluation Criteria

### Performance Metrics (1-10 Scale)
- **Load Speed**: Initial page load performance
- **PWA Performance**: Service worker efficiency and offline capabilities  
- **API Response Time**: Backend service response performance
- **CDN Utilization**: Static asset delivery optimization
- **Caching Strategy**: Browser and service worker caching effectiveness

### Operational Metrics (1-10 Scale)
- **Deployment Complexity**: Setup and configuration difficulty
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Ongoing management requirements
- **Scalability**: Growth accommodation capabilities
- **Cost Efficiency**: Railway pricing optimization
- **Development Experience**: Developer workflow and debugging

### Reliability Metrics (1-10 Scale)
- **Service Availability**: Uptime and failover capabilities
- **Network Resilience**: Performance under poor connectivity
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and recovery
- **Security**: Authentication and data protection
- **Monitoring**: Observability and debugging capabilities
