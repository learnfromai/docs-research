## üéØ Research Scope

This research analyzes **Railway.com deployment strategies** for Nx React/Express applications, specifically focusing on:

- **Deployment Approaches** - Separate static + service deployment vs unified Express static serving
- **Target Application** - Clinic Management System for 2-3 users
- **Technology Stack** - Nx monorepo with React/Vite frontend and Express.js backend
- **Performance Focus** - PWA capabilities, slow internet resilience, and small clinic requirements
- **Comprehensive Scoring** - 1-10 scale evaluation across multiple criteria with average scores

## üè• Clinic Management System Context

| Aspect | Details | Deployment Impact |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| **Users** | 2-3 clinic staff members | Low concurrent load, simple scaling needs |
| **Usage Pattern** | Business hours, regional access | Predictable traffic, geographic optimization |
| **Performance Goals** | PWA support, offline capability | Static asset caching, service worker strategy |
| **Internet Conditions** | Variable clinic internet quality | Resilience to connectivity issues |
| **Maintenance** | Minimal technical expertise | Simple deployment and monitoring |

## üõ† Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Railway.com Deployment Options |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------|
| **Monorepo** | Nx workspace | Multiple service deployment or build coordination |
| **Frontend** | React + Vite + TypeScript | Static site or Express static serving |
| **Backend** | Express.js + Node.js | Web service deployment |
| **PWA** | Service Worker + Manifest | Static asset optimization |
| **Database** | (Assumed) PostgreSQL/MySQL | Railway managed database |

## üéØ Deployment Strategy Comparison

### Strategy 1: Separate Deployments
- **Frontend**: Railway Static Site deployment
- **Backend**: Railway Web Service deployment
- **Benefits**: Independent scaling, CDN optimization, clear separation
- **Considerations**: CORS configuration, multiple service management

### Strategy 2: Unified Deployment
- **Architecture**: Express serves static React build via `express.static()`
- **Deployment**: Single Railway Web Service
- **Benefits**: Simplified deployment, single endpoint, no CORS issues
- **Considerations**: Server resource usage for static assets, scaling limitations
