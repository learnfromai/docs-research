Research about how I can have access to our manual task prod deployment with gitlab CI. At first, I thought having a maintainer role can do it. Same with merge access. But I found out that our merge rules is not based on roles, but we specifically include names/usernames/people not role-based. Research about the manual task deployment access.

Focus on:
- Understanding roles vs user-specific permissions for manual tasks
- How manual deployment permissions differ from merge permissions  
- What are the exact GitLab roles and capabilities for manual tasks?
- How to configure user-specific vs role-based manual deployment access?
- Best practices for secure production deployment workflows
- Common troubleshooting scenarios for deployment access issues

Create comprehensive documentation following established patterns with:
- Executive summary
- Implementation guide
- Best practices
- Permission models analysis
- Pipeline configuration examples
- Security considerations
- Troubleshooting guide

Include citations and practical examples throughout.
