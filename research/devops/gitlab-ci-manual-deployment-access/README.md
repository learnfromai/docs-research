# GitLab CI Manual Deployment Access Research

## 🎯 Project Overview

Comprehensive research on GitLab CI/CD manual deployment access control, focusing on understanding the differences between role-based permissions and user-specific permissions for production deployment workflows. This research addresses the confusion around manual task permissions vs merge access in GitLab CI pipelines.

## 🔧 Quick Reference

### GitLab Roles and Manual Deployment Access

| Role | Merge Access | Manual Job Trigger | Protected Environment Deploy | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------------------|------------------------------|-------|
| **Guest** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | Read-only access |
| **Reporter** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | Can view pipelines |
| **Developer** | ✅* | ✅* | ❌ | Depends on branch protection |
| **Maintainer** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅** | Full project control |
| **Owner** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Full project and settings |

*\*Subject to branch protection rules*  
*\*\*Subject to protected environment rules*

### Manual Deployment Access Matrix

| Access Level | Branch Protection | Environment Protection | Manual Jobs | User-Specific Rules |
|--------------|------------------|----------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Standard Role-Based** | Follows project roles | Follows project roles | Role-based | No |
| **Protected Branch Rules** | Custom user/role list | Inherits branch rules | Custom list | Yes |
| **Protected Environment** | Inherits from branch | Custom user/role list | Environment-specific | Yes |
| **Pipeline-Level Rules** | Pipeline permissions | Pipeline permissions | Custom conditions | Yes |

### Key Permission Concepts

```yaml
# Manual deployment access is controlled by:
1. Project role permissions
2. Protected branch rules (push/merge)
3. Protected environment rules (deploy)
4. Pipeline job conditions (rules/when)
5. User-specific allowlists
```

## 🔍 Research Scope & Methodology

### Primary Research Goals
- ✅ **Permission Model Analysis**: Understanding role-based vs user-specific access control
- ✅ **Manual Job Configuration**: How to configure manual deployment triggers
- ✅ **Security Best Practices**: Production deployment security patterns  
- ✅ **Troubleshooting Guide**: Common access issues and solutions

### Research Methodology
- Analysis of GitLab CI/CD permission architecture
- Review of official GitLab documentation patterns
- Best practice analysis from DevOps community
- Security-focused deployment workflow analysis

### Key Questions Answered
1. **Why maintainer role doesn't guarantee manual deployment access?**
2. **How do protected environments override project roles?**
3. **What's the difference between merge rules and deployment rules?**
4. **How to configure user-specific manual deployment access?**

## ✅ Goals Achieved

✅ **Permission Clarity**: Clear explanation of GitLab's layered permission system for manual deployments  
✅ **Configuration Examples**: Working YAML examples for different access patterns  
✅ **Security Framework**: Comprehensive security considerations for production deployments  
✅ **Troubleshooting Guide**: Practical solutions for common access issues  
✅ **Best Practices**: Operational recommendations for team-based deployment workflows  
✅ **User vs Role Analysis**: Detailed comparison of permission approaches
