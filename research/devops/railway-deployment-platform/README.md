## ðŸš€ Quick Reference

### Railway.com Platform Overview

| Feature | Description | Key Benefit |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Deploy from Git** | Automatic deployments from GitHub/GitLab | Zero-config CI/CD |
| **Instant Databases** | PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis | Managed database hosting |
| **Zero Config** | Automatic framework detection | Fast deployment setup |
| **Global Edge** | CDN and edge deployment | Low latency worldwide |
| **Team Collaboration** | Shared environments and permissions | Team development |
| **Custom Domains** | SSL certificates included | Professional deployment |

### Pricing Plans Comparison

| Plan | Monthly Cost | Credits Included | Key Features |
|------|-------------|------------------|--------------|
| **Developer** | $5 | $5 usage | Personal projects, 1 environment |
| **Pro** | $20 minimum | $20 usage | Production apps, unlimited environments |
| **Team** | $100 minimum | $100 usage | Team collaboration, advanced features |

### Resource Limits by Plan

| Resource | Developer | Pro | Team |
|----------|-----------|-----|------|
| **RAM per Service** | 8 GB | 32 GB | 32 GB |
| **vCPU per Service** | 8 vCPU | 32 vCPU | 32 vCPU |
| **Storage** | Pay-per-use | Pay-per-use | Pay-per-use |
| **Bandwidth** | Pay-per-use | Pay-per-use | Pay-per-use |
| **Team Seats** | 1 | Unlimited | Unlimited |

## ðŸ’¡ Key Research Findings

### Credit System Explanation
- **Credits = USD**: 1 credit = $1 USD
- **Monthly Minimum**: Pro plan requires minimum $20/month usage
- **Pay-as-you-go**: Only pay for actual resource consumption
- **Rollover**: Unused credits do not roll over to next month

### Nx Monorepo Deployment Strategy
```typescript
// Railway supports multiple services per project
// Deploy separate apps from same repository:
// 1. apps/api -> Railway Service (Express API)
// 2. apps/web -> Railway Service (React/Vite)
// 3. Database -> Railway Database Service
```

### Low-Traffic Cost Estimate (Clinic Management)
- **Small clinic (2-3 users)**: ~$5-10/month total
- **API service**: 512MB RAM, minimal CPU (~$3-5/month)
- **Web app**: Static hosting (~$1-2/month)  
- **MySQL database**: 1GB storage (~$1-3/month)
