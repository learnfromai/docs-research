## 💰 Pricing Model & Credit System

### Plan Structure
| Plan | Monthly Minimum | Credits Included | Target Users |
|------|----------------|------------------|--------------|
| **Developer** | $5 | $5 usage | Individual developers, hobby projects |
| **Pro** | $20 | $20 usage | Production applications, professional developers |
| **Team** | $100 | $100 usage | Development teams, enterprise applications |

### Credit System Mechanics
- **1 Credit = $1 USD**: Direct currency conversion
- **Monthly Billing**: Credits reset each month (no rollover)
- **Usage-Based**: Only pay for actual resource consumption
- **Overages**: Additional usage billed at standard rates

### Resource Pricing (Approximate)
```typescript
// Typical monthly costs for small clinic application:
const clinicCosts = {
  apiService: {
    ram: "512MB",
    cpu: "0.5 vCPU", 
    monthlyCost: "$3-5"
  },
  webApp: {
    type: "Static hosting",
    bandwidth: "< 10GB",
    monthlyCost: "$1-2"
  },
  database: {
    type: "MySQL",
    storage: "1-2GB",
    monthlyCost: "$1-3"
  },
  totalEstimate: "$5-10/month"
};
```

## 🏗️ Nx Monorepo Deployment Strategy

### Multi-Service Architecture
Railway excels at deploying monorepo projects with multiple services:

```yaml
# Project Structure for Railway Deployment
clinic-management-nx/
├── apps/
│   ├── api/           # Express.js backend → Railway Service
│   └── web/           # React/Vite frontend → Railway Service  
├── libs/              # Shared libraries
└── railway.json      # Railway configuration
```

### Deployment Workflow
1. **Connect Repository**: Link GitHub/GitLab repository to Railway
2. **Service Creation**: Create separate Railway services for each app
3. **Build Configuration**: Railway auto-detects Nx commands
4. **Environment Variables**: Configure database connections and API endpoints
5. **Domain Setup**: Custom domains for production deployment

## 📊 Resource Management & Sharing

### Service Communication
- **Internal Networking**: Services communicate via private network
- **Environment Variables**: Shared configuration across services
- **Database Access**: Multiple services can connect to same database
- **Load Balancing**: Automatic scaling based on traffic

### Resource Allocation
- **Per-Service Limits**: Each service has independent resource allocation
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Automatic scaling based on demand
- **Shared Resources**: Databases can be accessed by multiple services
- **Cost Optimization**: Pay only for actual usage per service

## 🏥 Clinic Management System Analysis

### Deployment Architecture
```typescript
// Optimal Railway setup for clinic management
const clinicArchitecture = {
  services: [
    {
      name: "clinic-api",
      type: "Node.js/Express",
      resources: "512MB RAM, 0.5 vCPU",
      purpose: "Backend API, authentication, business logic"
    },
    {
      name: "clinic-web", 
      type: "React/Vite Static",
      resources: "CDN hosting",
      purpose: "Frontend application"
    },
    {
      name: "clinic-db",
      type: "MySQL Database",
      resources: "1-2GB storage",
      purpose: "Patient data, appointments, records"
    }
  ]
};
```

### Cost Projection for Small Clinic
- **User Load**: 2-3 concurrent users
- **Data Volume**: ~1GB initial, growing ~100MB/month
- **Traffic**: <1000 requests/day
- **Estimated Monthly Cost**: $5-10 (well under $20 Pro minimum)

### Pro Plan Benefits for Clinic
- **32GB RAM/CPU limits**: Plenty of headroom for growth
- **Unlimited environments**: Development, staging, production
- **Team collaboration**: Multiple staff members can access
- **Priority support**: Critical for healthcare applications
