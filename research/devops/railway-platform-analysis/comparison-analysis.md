    name: clinic-api
    env: node
    buildCommand: nx build api
    startCommand: node dist/apps/api/main.js
    plan: starter
```

#### ❌ **Higher Costs for Small Projects**
- **Minimum service costs:** $7/month per service

    github:
      repo: your-org/clinic-management
      branch: main
    run_command: node dist/apps/api/main.js
```

#### ❌ **Configuration Complexity**
- **Manual optimization:** Requires more DevOps knowledge
- **Limited automation:** More manual configuration needed
- **Slower iterations:** Longer deployment times

### Heroku Limitations

#### ❌ **Outdated Architecture**
- **Dyno model:** 24-hour sleep on free tier
