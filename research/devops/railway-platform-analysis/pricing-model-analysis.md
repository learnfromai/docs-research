# Pricing Model Analysis: Railway.com Credit System

## 🎯 Overview

Railway.com uses a **usage-based pricing model** with a credit system that provides flexibility for varying workloads. This analysis breaks down how credits work, plan comparisons, and cost optimization strategies.

## 💳 Credit System Fundamentals

### How Credits Work

**Core Principles:**
- Credits are consumed based on **actual resource usage** (CPU, RAM, storage, network)
- **Time-based consumption** - resources are metered per second
- **Pay-for-what-you-use** model, not flat-rate pricing
- Credits can **roll over** month-to-month if unused

**Resource Consumption:**
```
Credit Calculation = (CPU usage × CPU rate) + (RAM usage × RAM rate) + 
                    (Storage × Storage rate) + (Network × Network rate)
```

### Credit Pricing Structure

| Resource Type | Rate | Unit | Notes |
|---------------|------|------|-------|
| **CPU** | $0.000463/vCPU | per hour | Shared compute resources |
| **RAM** | $0.000231/GB | per hour | Flexible allocation |
| **Storage** | $0.25/GB | per month | Persistent disk storage |
| **Network** | $0.10/GB | per transfer | Outbound data transfer |

## 📈 Cost Optimization Strategies

### 1. Resource Optimization

**CPU Optimization:**
```javascript
// Efficient Express.js configuration
const app = express();

// Enable compression
app.use(compression());

// Implement connection pooling for database
const pool = mysql.createPool({
  connectionLimit: 5,  // Limit concurrent connections
  host: process.env.DB_HOST,
  user: process.env.DB_USER,
  password: process.env.DB_PASS,
  database: process.env.DB_NAME
});
```

**Memory Optimization:**
```javascript
// Implement caching to reduce database queries
const NodeCache = require('node-cache');
const cache = new NodeCache({ stdTTL: 600 }); // 10 minute cache

app.get('/api/patients', async (req, res) => {
  const cacheKey = 'patients_list';
  let patients = cache.get(cacheKey);
  
  if (!patients) {
    patients = await db.query('SELECT * FROM patients');
    cache.set(cacheKey, patients);
  }
  
  res.json(patients);
});
```

### 2. Database Optimization

**Storage Efficiency:**
```sql
-- Use appropriate data types
CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,          -- Not VARCHAR(255) if not needed
  phone CHAR(10),                      -- Fixed length for phone numbers
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  INDEX idx_name (name)                -- Only necessary indexes
);
```

**Query Optimization:**
```sql
-- Efficient queries to reduce CPU usage
SELECT id, name, phone FROM patients 
WHERE created_at >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
LIMIT 50;

-- Avoid SELECT * queries
-- Use appropriate WHERE clauses and LIMIT
```

### 3. Frontend Optimization

**Bundle Optimization:**
```javascript
// vite.config.js
export default defineConfig({
  build: {
    rollupOptions: {
      output: {
        manualChunks: {
          vendor: ['react', 'react-dom'],
          ui: ['@mui/material']
        }
      }
    },
    minify: 'terser',
    cssMinify: true
  }
});
```

**Caching Strategy:**
```javascript
// Implement service worker for caching
// Cache static assets and API responses
self.addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {
  if (event.request.url.includes('/api/')) {
    event.respondWith(
      caches.open('api-cache').then(cache => {
        return cache.match(event.request).then(response => {
          return response || fetch(event.request);
        });
      })
    );
  }
});
```

## 📊 Advanced Pricing Scenarios

### Scaling Considerations

```

### Cost Monitoring & Alerts

**CLI Monitoring:**
```bash
# Check current usage
railway usage

# View billing details
railway billing

# Set up usage alerts (via dashboard)
railway dashboard
```

**API Monitoring:**
```javascript
// Monitor resource usage in application
const os = require('os');

setInterval(() => {
  const usage = {
    memory: process.memoryUsage(),
    cpu: os.loadavg(),
    uptime: process.uptime()
  };
  
  console.log('Resource usage:', usage);
  
  // Alert if memory usage exceeds threshold
  if (usage.memory.rss > 100 * 1024 * 1024) { // 100MB
    console.warn('High memory usage detected');
  }
}, 60000); // Check every minute
```
