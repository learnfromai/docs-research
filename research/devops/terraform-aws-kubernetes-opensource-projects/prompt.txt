Research Request: Perform research for open source devops projects that uses terraform with AWS and/or with kubernetes and/or EKS

Goal is to have reference to study production-ready devops projects. Look as many as you can. I want to learn how terraform with AWS and/or with kubernetes and/or EKS is properly used.

This research will analyze high-quality open source projects that demonstrate best practices for:
- Infrastructure as Code using Terraform
- AWS services integration (especially EKS, ECS, EC2, VPC, etc.)
- Kubernetes and EKS for container orchestration
- CI/CD pipeline implementations
- Security and monitoring best practices
- Production-ready deployment patterns

The research will focus on learning from real-world implementations to understand proper usage patterns, architecture decisions, and best practices for Terraform + AWS + Kubernetes/EKS stacks.
