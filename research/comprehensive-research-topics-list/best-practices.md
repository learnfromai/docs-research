- Experimental technology evaluation

Low Impact + High Effort = Avoid
- Deprecated technology deep dives
- Over-engineered solutions for simple problems
- Non-transferable skill development
```

#### Career Alignment Evaluation
1. **Current Role Relevance**: Direct applicability to existing responsibilities
2. **Target Role Requirements**: Skills needed for career advancement goals
3. **Market Demand**: Industry trends and job posting frequency
4. **Differentiation Value**: Unique skill combinations and competitive advantages

### Research Depth Calibration

#### Breadth vs. Depth Decision Framework
```
Breadth Focus (Survey Research):
- Emerging technology landscape exploration
- Framework comparison and selection
- Market analysis and trend identification

Depth Focus (Detailed Research):
- Production implementation strategies
- Performance optimization techniques
- Security and compliance requirements

Balanced Approach:
- Full-stack development topics
- Business and technical integration
- Leadership and technical skills combination
```

## üé® Content Creation Excellence

### Code Examples and Technical Content

#### Code Quality Standards
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Complete, tested example with context
interface UserRepository {
  findById(id: string): Promise<User | null>;
  create(userData: CreateUserRequest): Promise<User>;
}

class PostgreSQLUserRepository implements UserRepository {
  constructor(private db: Database) {}
  
  async findById(id: string): Promise<User | null> {
    const result = await this.db.query(
      'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1',
      [id]
    );
    return result.rows[0] || null;
  }
}

// ‚ùå Avoid: Incomplete or untested examples
// const user = await repo.find(id); // Missing context and error handling
```

#### Documentation Integration
- Include relevant imports and setup requirements
- Provide context for when and why to use specific patterns
- Show both successful implementation and error handling
- Include performance considerations and trade-offs

### Visual Content and Diagrams
