## 🏗️ Architecture Comparison

### Data Model Comparison

#### PostgreSQL: Relational Model
```sql
-- Normalized relational structure
-- Users table
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    first_name VARCHAR(100),
    last_name VARCHAR(100),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Courses table with foreign key relationships
CREATE TABLE courses (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    instructor_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    category_id UUID REFERENCES categories(id),
    price DECIMAL(10,2),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Enrollments junction table
CREATE TABLE enrollments (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    course_id UUID REFERENCES courses(id),
    enrolled_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    progress JSONB,
    UNIQUE(user_id, course_id)
);

-- Benefits:
-- ✅ Strong data consistency
-- ✅ Eliminates data duplication
-- ✅ Enforces referential integrity
-- ✅ Complex joins and aggregations

## 🚀 Performance Analysis

### Query Performance Comparison

#### Simple CRUD Operations

```sql
-- PostgreSQL: User lookup with enrollment data
-- Execution time: ~2-5ms with proper indexing
SELECT 
    u.id, u.email, u.first_name, u.last_name,
    COUNT(e.id) as enrollment_count,
    AVG(c.rating) as avg_course_rating
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN enrollments e ON u.id = e.user_id
LEFT JOIN courses c ON e.course_id = c.id
WHERE u.id = $1
GROUP BY u.id, u.email, u.first_name, u.last_name;
```

```javascript
// MongoDB: User lookup with enrollment data
// Execution time: ~1-3ms with proper indexing
db.users.findOne(
  { "_id": ObjectId("user_id") },
  {
    "email": 1,
    "firstName": 1, 
    "lastName": 1,
    "enrollments": 1,
    "profile.avatar": 1
  }
);
```

**Result**: MongoDB faster for single document retrieval due to denormalization.

#### Complex Aggregations

```sql
-- PostgreSQL: Course analytics with multiple joins
-- Execution time: ~50-200ms depending on data size
SELECT 
    c.category_id,
    cat.name as category_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT c.id) as course_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT e.user_id) as unique_students,
    AVG(c.rating) as avg_rating,
    SUM(c.price) as total_revenue,
    DATE_TRUNC('month', e.enrolled_at) as enrollment_month
FROM courses c
JOIN categories cat ON c.category_id = cat.id
JOIN enrollments e ON c.id = e.course_id
WHERE e.enrolled_at >= '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY c.category_id, cat.name, DATE_TRUNC('month', e.enrolled_at)
ORDER BY enrollment_month DESC, total_revenue DESC;
```

```javascript
// MongoDB: Course analytics with aggregation pipeline
// Execution time: ~100-500ms depending on data size and indexing
db.enrollments.aggregate([
  {
    $match: {
      "enrolledAt": { $gte: ISODate("2024-01-01") }
    }
  },
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "courses",
      localField: "courseId",
      foreignField: "_id",
      as: "course"
    }
  },
  {
    $unwind: "$course"
  },
  {
    $group: {
      _id: {
        category: "$course.category",
        month: { $dateToString: { format: "%Y-%m", date: "$enrolledAt" } }
      },
      courseCount: { $addToSet: "$courseId" },
      uniqueStudents: { $addToSet: "$userId" },
      avgRating: { $avg: "$course.rating" },
      totalRevenue: { $sum: "$course.price" }
    }
  },
  {
    $project: {
      category: "$_id.category",
      month: "$_id.month",
      courseCount: { $size: "$courseCount" },
      uniqueStudents: { $size: "$uniqueStudents" },
      avgRating: 1,
      totalRevenue: 1
    }
  },
  {
    $sort: { "month": -1, "totalRevenue": -1 }
  }
]);
```

**Result**: PostgreSQL generally faster for complex analytical queries due to mature query optimizer.

### Developer Productivity

#### PostgreSQL Development
```typescript
// ✅ Strongly typed with TypeScript
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  createdAt: Date;
}

interface Course {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  instructorId: string;
  price: number;
  rating: number;
}

// Type-safe queries with libraries like Prisma
const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({
  where: { id: userId },
  include: {
    enrollments: {
      include: {
        course: true
      }
    }
  }
});

// ❌ Challenges:
// - Schema migrations required
// - Complex relationships can lead to N+1 queries
// - Rigid schema can slow feature development
```

#### MongoDB Development
```typescript
// ✅ Flexible document structure
interface UserDocument {
  _id: ObjectId;
  email: string;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  enrollments?: EnrollmentEmbedded[];
  profile?: UserProfile;
  createdAt: Date;
}

// Easy object mapping
const user = await db.collection('users').findOne(
  { _id: new ObjectId(userId) }
);

// ✅ Benefits:
// - Rapid prototyping
// - No schema migrations
// - Natural object mapping
// - Easy to add new fields

// ❌ Challenges:
// - Runtime type validation needed
// - Potential for data inconsistency
// - Complex queries can be verbose
